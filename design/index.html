          I decided to go for a minimalistic design with my website. I'm
          thinking of choosing green as my primary color, perhaps different
          shades could work so there's neough contrast. I'm used to working with
          whites and blacks a lot so I'll find a way to implement them on the
          website. I'll have to find a 5th color so everything doesn't end up
          being as drab as some of my other sites, maybe I can include some kind
          of color switching mechanic as you scroll down.

          <h2>Week 5 - Design Section</h2>

          <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            My website is designed for gamers and tech enthusiasts who prefer
            neat, contemporary designs of websites such as Bandai Namco and
            Kojima Productions. Others that I used for reference were the Meta
            website and OrangeYouGlad. I plan to create an engaging and
            picture-filled experience with just enough text to attract viewers
            to the content without bogging them down. The guiding principles
            behind my design are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>User Experience Consideration:</strong> Integrate
              back-to-top links, smooth transitions, and intuitive navigation to
              reduce unneeded scrolling fatigue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tech-Centric Design:</strong> Using a well-thought-out
              color scheme tied to color theory, presenting an even look that is
              natural for those accustomed to gaming and technology sector
              websites. I chose a green palette, I chose the color due to its
              having a strong association with coding in the contemporary tech
              space. The choice of minimalism was encouraged by the fact that a
              lot of companies from Silicon Valley seemed to be adopting that as
              of late.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content Hierarchy:</strong> My portfolio and blogs take
              center stage as they most aptly showcase my work while keeping the
              presentation neat for information transmission.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Information Structure - Content Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            Information is organised to prevent it from becoming cluttered yet
            remains as convenient as possible:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Homepage:</strong> Initially planned to be a simple
              welcome page, I have redesigned it to have an introduction that
              features a preview of my blogs so that the users can interact at
              once without having to only rely on the navigation bar.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navigation Bar:</strong> Alphabetically ordered for
              convenience, to have all sections easily accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blogs:</strong> Aggregated on a blog hub page where users
              can view abbreviated versions before reading full articles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design Page:</strong> Holds wireframes and research
              results, aggregating content into categories without burdening the
              reader.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User Pathways:</strong> Purposefully placed buttons and
              links lead users to the most relevant areas with fewer steps to
              navigate.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In respects to the font color, I may choose to use a gradient on
            some headings against a contrasting background of either black or
            white. I see this is a common occurrence on tech or gaming
            orientated website where some kind of gradient will be located on
            the screen whether it be in text or in the background itself.
            Through a combination of these tenets, my website aims to achieve an
            ideal blend of visual appeal and effectiveness without bombarding
            the user with too much information all at once, in a seamless and
            eye-catching browsing experience for my target users.
          </p>

          <div class="wireframes-h">
            <img
              src="../images/design images/user flowchart.png"
              alt="A picture of the social media icons."
              width="600"
              height="456,25"
            />
            <p>Social media icons for the website.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>User Flow - Screens, Behavior, and Decisions</h3>
          <p>
            It directs users across the site with a guided flow that focuses on
            usability:
          </p>

          <h3>Entry Point (Homepage):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users are introduced to my work with minimalism and the least
              distractions.
            </li>
            <li>
              New text scrolls in with a dynamic appearance, keeping the user
              engaged.
            </li>
            <li>Blog previews are a natural way into deep content.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Navigation & Interaction:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The navbar remains simple and super-responsive, optimised for
              desktop and mobile users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apart from the navbar, only my blog and profile pages have direct
              links for quick access.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interactive buttons on blog cards encourage input in a
              non-intrusive manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each page smoothly transitions to the next, reducing users'
              cognitive load.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Content Consumption:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users navigate long-form blog pages with well-defined content to
              prevent information overload.
            </li>
            <li>
              The "learn more" approach ensures that content remains bite-sized
              but leaves space for deep diving when necessary
            </li>
            <li>
              Users looking for design details can link directly to relevant
              research and examples through an organised section.
            </li>
          </ul>
