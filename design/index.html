          <p>
            Update: I decided to go for a minimalistic design with my website.
            I'm thinking of choosing green as my primary color, perhaps
            different shades could work so there's enough contrast. I'm used to
            working with whites and blacks a lot so I'll find a way to implement
            them on the website. I'll have to find a 5th color so everything
            doesn't end up being as drab as some of my other sites, maybe I can
            include some kind of color switching mechanic as you scroll down.

            <h2>Week 5 - Design Section</h2>

            <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
            <p>
              My website is designed for gamers and tech enthusiasts who prefer
              neat, contemporary designs of websites such as Bandai Namco and
              Kojima Productions. Others that I used for reference were the Meta
              website and OrangeYouGlad. I plan to create an engaging and
              picture-filled experience with just enough text to attract viewers
              to the content without bogging them down.
            </p>

            <p>The guiding principles behind my design are:</p>

            <h4>User Experience Consideration:</h4>
            <p>
              Integrate back-to-top links, smooth transitions, and intuitive
              navigation to reduce unneeded scrolling fatigue.
            </p>

            <h4>Tech-Centric Design:</h4>
            <p>
              Using a well-thought-out color scheme tied to color theory,
              presenting an even look that is natural for those accustomed to
              gaming and technology sector websites. I chose a green palette, I
              chose the color due to its having a strong association with coding
              in the contemporary tech space. The choice of minimalism was
              encouraged by the fact that a lot of companies from Silicon Valley
              seemed to be adopting that as of late.
            </p>

            <h4>Content Hierarchy:</h4>
            <p>
              My portfolio and blogs take center stage as they most aptly
              showcase my work while keeping the presentation neat for
              information transmission.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Structure - Content Mapping</h3>
            <p>
              Information is organised to prevent it from becoming cluttered yet
              remains as convenient as possible:
            </p>

            <h4>Homepage:</h4>
            <p>
              Initially planned to be a simple welcome page, I have redesigned
              it to have an introduction that features a preview of my blogs so
              that the users can interact at once without having to only rely on
              the navigation bar.
            </p>

            <h4>Navigation Bar:</h4>
            <p>
              Alphabetically ordered for convenience, to have all sections
              easily accessible.
            </p>

            <h4>Blogs:</h4>
            <p>
              Aggregated on a blog hub page where users can view abbreviated
              versions before reading full articles.
            </p>

            <h4>Design Page:</h4>
            <p>
              Holds wireframes and research results, aggregating content into
              categories without burdening the reader.
            </p>

            <h4>User Pathways:</h4>
            <p>
              Purposefully placed buttons and links lead users to the most
              relevant areas with fewer steps to navigate.
            </p>

            <p>
              In respects to the font color, I may choose to use a gradient on
              some headings against a contrasting background of either black or
              white. I see this is a common occurrence on tech or gaming
              orientated website where some kind of gradient will be located on
              the screen whether it be in text or in the background itself.
              Through a combination of these tenets, my website aims to achieve
              an ideal blend of visual appeal and effectiveness without
              bombarding the user with too much information all at once, in a
              seamless and eye-catching browsing experience for my target users.
            </p>

            <div class="wireframes-h">
              <img
                src="../images/design images/user_flowchart.png"
                alt="A picture of the social media icons."
              />
              <p>Social media icons for the website.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>User Flow - Screens, Behavior, and Decisions</h3>
            <p>
              It directs users across the site with a guided flow that focuses
              on usability:
            </p>

            <h4>Entry Point (Homepage):</h4>
            <p>
              Users are introduced to my work with minimalism and the least
              distractions.
            </p>
            <p>
              New text scrolls in with a dynamic appearance, keeping the user
              engaged.
            </p>
            <p>Blog previews are a natural way into deep content.</p>

            <h4>Navigation & Interaction:</h4>
            <p>
              The navbar remains simple and super-responsive, optimised for
              desktop and mobile users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from the navbar, only my blog and profile pages have direct
              links for quick access.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interactive buttons on blog cards encourage input in a
              non-intrusive manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each page smoothly transitions to the next, reducing users'
              cognitive load.
            </p>

            <h4>Content Consumption:</h4>
            <p>
              Users navigate long-form blog pages with well-defined content to
              prevent information overload.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "learn more" approach ensures that content remains bite-sized
              but leaves space for deep diving when necessary
            </p>
            <p>
              Users looking for design details can link directly to relevant
              research and examples through an organised section.
            </p>

            <h3>List and Description of Interface Elements Chosen</h3>

            <h4>Typography:</h4>
            <p>
              Roboto is employed for its clean, contemporary look that enhances
              readability alongside the technology-conscious theme.
            </p>

            <h4>Color Scheme:</h4>
            <p>Light Green (Background) – Produces a soft, clean background.</p>
            <p>
              Black (Buttons & Text) – Offers high contrast for readability.
            </p>
            <p>
              White (Task Bar) – Maintains a clean and sleek navigation
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soft Green (Content Buttons) – Attracts attention to clickable
              elements without crowding the design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vivid Yellow (Navigation Highlight & Button Text) – Brings the
              attention to primary interactions and page indicators.
            </p>

            <h4>Button Interactions:</h4>
            <p>
              Buttons display light scaling, color transition, and box shadows
              as feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Light border-radius yields a gentler feel in a bid to maintain the
              overall appearance.
            </p>

            <h4>Animations & Transitions</h4>
            <p>
              Smooth page transition abolishes jarring jumps, improving the
              browsing experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interactive elements like blog cards and navbar menus simplify
              usability without distraction.
            </p>

            <h3>Additional Considerations Made</h3>
            <p>
              One of the changes I made later on was adjusting the border-radius
              of most elements to 25px. I found this visually appealing and more
              consistent with the style of my navbar. Additionally, I replaced
              the standard scrolling navbar with a sticky one, which felt more
              modern and user-friendly. Inspired by other websites, I also
              implemented a hamburger icon for mobile devices, along with a
              specialised mobile menu, something I wasn’t able to include in my
              previous submission.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working on the essay page, I experimented with different
              layout styles I found online. I ended up incorporating some of
              those ideas because I liked how they looked. That design
              exploration actually influenced my decision to standardize the
              border radius site-wide. It also led to some updates in the blog
              section, though I still feel the look there isn’t fully optimised
              yet. I’ve retained the original color scheme and plan to gradually
              apply the new styles across the rest of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of functionality, I used JavaScript to toggle between a
              hamburger icon and an X icon when the mobile menu is opened. I’m
              also planning to use JavaScript to highlight the active page in
              the navbar by making its link bold and possibly adjusting its
              color to match my existing color swatches. That feature isn’t
              fully working yet, but it’s something I intend to get right soon.
              Overall, these updates are aimed at improving both the look and
              usability of the site across devices. Another thing which may be a
              minor change but I still found noteworthy enough to talk about is
              the exclusion of my fourth planned color from the overall website
              look. I was unable to find a suitable place to integrate it
              without making the website veer away from its established
              aesthetic.
