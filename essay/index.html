            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              While first going through the 24BitGameStudio website, I initially
              considered its general design elements, i.e., the font size
              consistency, the purposeful utilisation of background colors to
              direct users' attention, and the chromatic equilibrium that
              accompanies their brand identity. A more critical inspection of
              the site through the lens of web accessibility and ethical user
              experience design principles, however, revealed several points
              that merit further discussion. Website accessibility should not be
              treated as a compliance matter alone; rather, it is a core
              commitment to inclusive design that addresses the needs of all
              users with or without disabilities. This essay aims to assess the
              24BitGameStudio website's performance based on standard
              accessibility guidelines and ethical user experience frameworks.
            </p>

            <h2>Visual Design Elements</h2>
            <p>
              The 24BitGameStudio website demonstrates thoughtful attention to
              visual design, particularly in its consistent use of brand colors.
              The background colors effectively differentiate sections and guide
              the user's visual flow through the content. The navbar buttons
              also provide interactive feedback, changing color upon hover
              (glowing blue) and when pressed (turning red), the latter of which
              also indicates to the user what page they are on, which provides
              clear visual feedback, which enhances user interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the color coordination with the logo fosters a streamlined
              visual experience, this does not necessarily guarantee
              accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies or low
              vision. The website primarily uses hues of blue, red, white, and
              dark grey. Although these colors can be visually striking, they
              may still present challenges if used without adequate contrast or
              if critical information is conveyed through color alone. For
              example, users with red-green color blindness, a common form of
              color vision deficiency, may struggle to distinguish between
              certain shades of red and grey.
            </p>
            <p>
              A notable accessibility issue concerns the site's interactive
              elements. While navbar buttons change color when hovered or
              clicked, standard buttons and form elements lack visual feedback
              for interaction states. This absence of clear focus indicators
              violates accessibility best practices and creates significant
              barriers for keyboard users, particularly those with motor
              disabilities who can't use a mouse. Without visible indicators
              showing their current location during keyboard navigation, these
              users face unnecessary difficulties interacting with the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I observed inconsistencies in typography across the
              website, particularly in the use of capitalisation. For example,
              the contact page features text that is written entirely in
              uppercase letters, in contrast to the rest of the site, excluding
              the game preview section, which predominantly uses standard
              sentence case (capitalised first letters followed by lowercase).
              While the use of all caps may have been intended to create
              emphasis, such typographic inconsistency can introduce cognitive
              friction for users. This is especially true for individuals with
              cognitive disabilities, who benefit from uniform and predictable
              visual patterns. All-caps text can also reduce readability, as it
              disrupts the familiar shapes of words that readers rely on for
              quick recognition. I found myself suffering from that as well
              since I find familiarity comforting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite this issue, the website maintains legible font sizes
              across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms, demonstrating an
              understanding of responsive design principles. This adaptability
              is important for accessibility, ensuring that text remains
              readable across various devices and screen dimensions.
            </p>

            <h2>Content and Information Structure</h2>
            <p>
              A critical aspect of my accessibility testing involved using a
              screen reader to navigate the 24BitGameStudio website, where I
              encountered significant barriers related to image accessibility.
              While using Microsoft Edge's immersive screen reader mode, I found
              that images across the site were not being read aloud, posing a
              substantial accessibility issue for visually impaired users who
              rely on screen readers to access content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon further inspection with developer tools, I noted that the
              images, particularly in the service and client sections, were
              named using generic filenames such as "service1," "service2," and
              "client1." This naming convention introduces two primary
              accessibility concerns:
            </p>
            <p>
              First, even if the screen reader were properly configured, these
              generic names offer no meaningful description of the image
              content. For instance, a user might hear "client1" without
              understanding which client the image represents or what the image
              itself depicts. This lack of descriptive alt text directly
              contradicts Vaidya's (2020) assertion that "the alternative text
              for each image must convey the meaning the image is intended to
              communicate, not merely describe what the image looks like."
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, the failure to announce images in screen reader mode
              suggests possible technical issues in the website's
              implementation, such as missing alt attributes, improper ARIA
              roles, or problems with the HTML structure. According to Vaidya
              (2020), "alternative text is not required for decorative images,"
              but logos and service illustrations carry meaningful information
              and should be described appropriately to accommodate non-visual
              users. The lack of these descriptions further compounds the
              accessibility barriers that visually impaired users face.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also encountered a significant navigation barrier on the
              home/about page. When activating the immersive screen reader mode,
              the page is simplified visually, presumably to enhance
              readability. However, this simplified version removed navigation
              options, effectively trapping users on the page. As I noted during
              testing, "When simplified, I cannot navigate to any other page.
              When I exit this immersive screen reader mode, I can navigate
              freely to other pages." This restricted experience violates core
              principles of accessible design, which emphasise providing equal
              access for all users, regardless of their method of interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, I found that the 'read aloud' feature on other pages
              did not support image descriptions, creating an inconsistent user
              experience. As I observed, I cannot activate the immersive screen
              reader on those pages; instead, I can click on 'read aloud,' which
              does not account for images. This inconsistency highlights
              potential issues with the semantic structure of the website.
              Proper semantic HTML is essential for screen reader compatibility,
              as it informs assistive technologies how to interpret and navigate
              content. Vaidya (2020) emphasises that "headings must be
              structured appropriately in the design specifications. Skipping
              heading levels is not recommended, as it disrupts the structure."
              Without a consistent heading hierarchy and semantic markup, screen
              readers cannot effectively communicate the organisation of
              content, making navigation difficult.
            </p>

            <h3>Dynamic Content Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              The inconsistent behavior between pages, where only the home/about
              page changes its presentation in screen reader mode, suggests
              uneven implementation of accessibility features. Such
              inconsistencies can be particularly challenging for users with
              cognitive disabilities, who benefit from predictable patterns and
              consistent behaviors. Moreover, the 24BitGameStudio website
              features a section where client logos scroll horizontally in a
              carousel format. While visually engaging, this dynamic content
              presents several accessibility challenges. The images in the
              carousel are generically named (e.g., "client1"), which fails to
              provide meaningful information to screen reader users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vaidya (2020) specifically addresses this issue, noting that "the
              user should be given control to stop, pause, or hide any content
              or information that appears on the interface that moves, blinks,
              or scrolls." During my testing, I did not observe any controls
              that would allow users to pause or control the carousel's
              movement, suggesting non-compliance with this important
              accessibility guideline.
            </p>

            <h3>Form Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              The contact page features forms for user input, which present
              their own set of accessibility considerations. While the slightly
              larger font size on this page might enhance readability for some
              users, other aspects of form accessibility require evaluation. For
              forms to be fully accessible, they should include properly
              associated labels, clear instructions, indication of required
              fields, and accessible error validation that doesn't rely solely
              on color to convey meaning. As Vaidya (2020) notes, "It is not a
              good practice to alert the user when there is an error by just
              changing the labels of a form to red color. Color should not be
              used as the only means to indicate an action in an interface."
            </p>
            <p>
              The 24BitGameStudio form does just that; however, the font size of
              the text indicator for error validation, as well as its color
              choice, makes it hard to read and a bit difficult to focus on.
              There also seems to be a strange inconsistency regarding the
              headings' color choice and that of the error validation, both are
              red; however, the former is a brighter hue that contrasts well
              against the background, while the other is a duller shade, which
              leads to the accessibility issues noted earlier.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              While analysing, I came across a curious choice regarding the data
              collection practices on the 24BitGameStudio website. The site
              collects extensive personal information, including identifying,
              contact, and demographic data, albeit for people or clients
              seeking more information through their contact section. Despite
              this comprehensive data gathering, the website lacks a cookie
              policy, raising significant ethical concerns regarding informed
              consent and transparency (Brignull, H., Leiser, M., Santos, C.,
              and Doshi, K., 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
              As Geyser (n.d. a) argues, ethical web design must prioritise
              "Privacy," "Transparency," and "Ethical Persuasion". This absence
              of cookie notifications particularly affects users from regions
              with strict privacy regulations like the EU, where GDPR mandates
              explicit consent. While omitting such notices might create a
              smoother user experience, it compromises ethical standards.
              Through the lens of "Design Justice" (Costanza-Chock, 2020;
              Geyser, n.d. b), this represents a problematic power imbalance
              between the website owner's extensive data collection and users'
              limited awareness, potentially violating ethical design
              principles.
            </p>

            <h2>User Experience and Interface Design</h2>
            <p>
              While the 24BitGameStudio website does not display overt cultural
              insensitivity, it lacks consideration for local usability in a
              South African context. The site is exclusively in English, which,
              while commonly used in business, is only the fourth most spoken
              language in the country, spoken by roughly 9% of the population.
              More widely spoken languages like Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans are
              notably absent, as are the remaining official languages of South
              Africa. Although users can rely on third-party translation tools,
              the absence of built-in multilingual support may be perceived as
              tone-deaf or exclusionary, especially given the country's
              linguistic diversity and constitutional commitment to language
              equity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their website maintains visual consistency across most pages,
              which should, in theory, support a predictable user experience.
              Font sizes for headings and paragraph text are consistent, and the
              layout adapts well across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
              Additionally, the use of different background colors to
              distinguish sections effectively supports visual hierarchy and
              guides the user's eye, helping to emphasise important content.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this visual consistency is undermined by significant
              inconsistencies in accessibility, particularly in how the site
              behaves with assistive technologies. Screen reader testing
              revealed that only the about page adapts its presentation in
              reader mode, while other pages remain unchanged. This creates an
              unpredictable and potentially frustrating experience for users
              relying on screen readers. Predictable navigation and consistent
              behavior are especially critical for users with cognitive
              disabilities or those unfamiliar with web conventions. As Vaidya
              (2020) emphasises, information architecture should prioritise
              accessibility for elderly users and those with cognitive
              challenges, with features like always-visible menus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, while visual cues like background colors help with
              organisation, they must be supported by proper semantic structure
              in the code. The inconsistencies uncovered in screen reader
              performance suggest that this underlying structure may not be
              fully accessible or well-implemented.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              This analysis reveals that the site's UI, UX, and IxD suffer from
              not only technical oversights but also critical ethical failings.
              The inconsistent support for assistive technologies, lack of focus
              indicators, and segregated immersive reader experience demonstrate
              a disregard for inclusive design, effectively marginalising users
              with disabilities. These are not isolated design flaws, they
              reflect broader systemic neglect of accessibility as a core value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Equally troubling is the lack of data transparency, with missing
              cookie policies and unclear consent mechanisms compromising user
              autonomy and trust (Geyser, n.d. a). Ethical UX requires respect
              for user agency and informed consent, both of which are undermined
              here.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Vaidya (2020) asserts, accessibility and inclusion should not
              be retrofitted but rather integrated into design from its earliest
              stages. The failure to do so in this case exemplifies a broader
              systemic issue in digital design, where accessibility is often
              deprioritised in favor of aesthetic or commercial goals. This
              neglect not only reinforces existing power imbalances, excluding
              those with less access or fewer abilities, but also contradicts
              the foundational ideals of user-centered design.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The digital age has presented unprecedented opportunities for
              global connectivity and the sharing of information. Yet, it has
              also contributed to the creation of new forms of colonial power
              structures that mirror historical patterns of domination and
              exploitation. Digital colonialism, as defined by Coleman (2018),
              represents "a modern-day 'Scramble for Africa' where large-scale
              tech companies extract, analyse, and own user data for profit and
              market influence with nominal benefit to the data source." This
              essay examines how Western-controlled social media platforms
              enable the systematic spread of misinformation about the Global
              South, using the recent case of Elon Musk's parroting of "white
              genocide" conspiracy theories about South Africa as a critical
              lens. The incident, which reached its peak in 2024–2025,
              demonstrates how digital colonial structures not only extract data
              and profits from African users but also impose harmful narratives
              that serve Western political interests while silencing African
              voices.
            </p>

            <h2>Understanding Digital Colonialism</h2>
            <p>
              Digital colonialism extends past economic exploitation to
              encompass what can be termed "epistemic violence", the systematic
              marginalisation and delegitimisation of non-Western ways of
              knowing and being. As noted in a recent scholarship, "digital
              colonialism, the systemic extraction and commodification of
              marginalised cultures through digital platforms, where those with
              privilege can claim ownership over traditions while the original
              communities lose control of their narratives" (OpenGlobalRights,
              n.d.). This framework is particularly relevant when examining how
              Western-owned platforms like X (formerly Twitter) become vehicles
              for spreading misinformation about African realities, despite the
              platform being owned by a South African ironically enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kwame Nkrumah's concept of neo-colonialism, which describes the
              practice of using economic, political, or cultural influence
              rather than direct military force to control former colonies,
              finds new expression in the digital age. Social media platforms,
              predominantly owned and operated by Western corporations, create
              algorithmic architectures that privilege certain voices while
              marginalising others, effectively recreating colonial hierarchies
              in digital spaces. Elon Musk's continued campaign to promote
              "white genocide" conspiracy theories about South Africa represents
              a paradigmatic example of digital colonialism in action. Beginning
              with renewed intensity in 2023 and continuing through 2025, Musk
              leveraged his massive following of over 200 million users on X to
              spread demonstrably false claims about systematic violence against
              white South Africans (The Washington Post 2023). "They are openly
              pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa," Musk
              tweeted, before asking why South African President Cyril Ramaphosa
              had said "nothing" about the incident (The Washington Post, 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
              The factual reality contradicts these claims. South African police
              recorded 26,232 murders nationwide in 2024, of which 44 were
              linked to farming communities (NBC News, 2025). Most murder
              victims in South Africa are Black, not white, and a South African
              court determined in February that claims of a white genocide in
              the country are not true (Reuters, 2025). Yet despite these facts
              being readily available and extensively documented by South
              African institutions and journalists, Musk's misinformation gained
              significant traction, even influencing U.S. foreign policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The colonial nature of this misinformation campaign becomes
              evident when examining its impact. President Donald Trump,
              influenced by these false narratives, offered asylum to white
              South Africans and maintained these positions even when directly
              confronted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (Fortune,
              2025). During a recent meeting, Trump continued to push the
              baseless conspiracy theory even with South Africa's president
              present to refute it directly (Fortune, 2025). This represents a
              form of epistemic violence where Western figures claim authority
              over African realities, dismissing the knowledge and lived
              experiences of Africans themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
              The structural inequalities inherent in Western-controlled social
              media platforms became startlingly apparent in how Musk's
              misinformation was amplified while South African
              counter-narratives were marginalised. Despite numerous South
              Africans, including white South Africans, actively refuting these
              claims on the platform, their voices were systematically
              diminished by algorithmic biases that prioritise engagement
              metrics over truth or local expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
              X's algorithm prioritises accounts with large followings and high
              engagement rates, creating what can be termed "algorithmic
              colonialism", a system where Western voices are structurally
              advantaged over those from the Global South, this is despite
              Musk's claims that the algorithm would boost smaller accounts to
              counter such biases . Lutz (2019) identifies this as part of the
              third-level digital divide, where disparities in outcomes emerge
              even when access and usage are similar. Western users with higher
              digital capital can translate engagement into influence, while
              Global South users face structural disadvantages in shaping
              discourse. This technological bias enabled Musk's false claims to
              reach millions while South African fact-checkers, journalists, and
              ordinary citizens struggled to gain visibility for accurate
              information about their own country.
            </p>
            <p>
              The community notes feature, supposedly designed to halt the
              spread of misinformation, failed in this case. Ironically, even
              Musk's own AI chatbot Grok contradicted his claims, noting that
              "No trustworthy sources back Elon Musk's 'white genocide' claim in
              South Africa; courts dismiss it as unfounded" (NBC News, 2025).
              However, the structural power imbalances on the platform meant
              that this correction had minimal impact compared to the original
              misinformation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The absence of widely used, African-controlled social media
              platforms that could provide alternative spaces for African
              narratives is something that can no longer be ignored. While
              countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal have
              initiated local digital media platforms, these applications
              reflect the South's ability to offer successful models based on
              the interests and priorities of their people, free from Western
              control. However, these platforms lack the global reach and
              influence of Western-controlled social media giants.
            </p>
            <p>
              This digital dependency creates what Frantz Fanon might have
              recognised as a form of psychological colonialism, where Africans
              are forced to contest representations of themselves on platforms
              owned and controlled by their former colonisers. The inability to
              control the technological infrastructure through which global
              conversations about Africa occur represents a fundamental form of
              digital subjugation.
            </p>

            <h2>The Role of Technology in Perpetuating Colonial Narratives</h2>
            <p>
              The recent revelation that Musk's chatbot Grok keeps bringing up
              false claims about 'white genocide' in South Africa unprompted
              demonstrates how colonial biases become embedded in artificial
              intelligence systems (Rolling Stone, 2025). This technological
              amplification of misinformation represents a new frontier in
              digital colonialism, where AI systems trained on biased data
              reproduce and amplify harmful stereotypes about the Global South.
              The digital space has demonstrated considerable bias, particularly
              through the democratisation of AI programming, which has resulted
              in explicit racism and sexism becoming ingrained in many AI
              platforms (Slate, 2025). In the case of Grok's obsession with
              "white genocide" narratives, we see how these biases manifest in
              concrete harm to African communities and international relations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The international ramifications of Musk's misinformation campaign
              showcase how digital colonialism intersects with traditional
              geopolitical power structures. The fact that false narratives
              propagated on a Western-owned platform could influence U.S.
              foreign policy toward South Africa demonstrates the continued
              salience of colonial relationships in the digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
              The situation escalated to the point where President Donald Trump
              maintained his false beliefs about South African "white genocide"
              even when directly confronted by President Ramaphosa with factual
              information (Reuters, 2025). This represents a direct material
              consequence of digital colonial violence, where misinformation
              spread through Western-controlled platforms translates into
              concrete diplomatic tensions and potential economic harm for
              African nations. Despite the structural disadvantages, South
              African resistance to these false narratives provides important
              insights into potential strategies for digital decolonisation. The
              coordinated efforts by South African social media users to counter
              Musk's misinformation, while ultimately limited by algorithmic
              biases, demonstrate the possibility of grassroots resistance
              within colonial digital structures.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, these efforts also highlight the inadequacy of individual
              resistance in the face of structural inequalities. As Shahid
              (2024) notes, "Around 75% of Internet users are from non-English
              speaking countries in the Majority World (i.e., Global South). Yet
              social media companies allocate most of their content moderation
              resources to English speaking populations in the West." This
              disparity in content moderation resources meant that harmful
              misinformation about South Africa received insufficient attention
              from platform moderators. This highlights the urgent need for what
              might be termed "digital sovereignty", the ability of nations and
              communities in the Global South to control the technological
              infrastructure through which narratives about them are constructed
              and disseminated. This involves not just creating alternative
              platforms but developing entirely different models of digital
              interaction that prioritise truth, community well-being, and
              cultural authenticity over engagement metrics and profit
              maximisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              As noted by digital rights advocates, "As Big Tech's data and
              profit extraction extends the world over, activists in the Global
              South are pointing the way to a more just digital future"
              (OpenGlobalRights, n.d.). These efforts must be supported and
              scaled to challenge the current digital colonial order.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The case of Elon Musk's amplification of "white genocide"
              misinformation about South Africa represents a paradigmatic
              example of digital colonialism in the contemporary era. Through
              his control of a major social media platform and his massive
              following, Musk was able to impose false narratives about African
              realities that influenced international relations and policy,
              despite consistent refutation by South Africans themselves. This
              shows how digital colonial structures operate through algorithmic
              biases, unequal resource allocation, and the systematic
              privileging of Western voices over Global South perspectives. The
              inability of South Africans to effectively counter these
              narratives on a platform owned by their former colonial powers
              demonstrates the continued salience of colonial relationships in
              digital spaces. Moving forward, the development of
              African-controlled digital platforms and the establishment of
              digital sovereignty frameworks will be crucial for challenging
              these colonial structures. Only through such efforts can the
              Global South begin to reclaim control over the narratives that
              shape international perceptions and policies regarding their
              societies. The fight against digital colonialism is not merely a
              technological challenge but a fundamental struggle for epistemic
              justice and the right of all peoples to define themselves in the
              digital age.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Looking back on my website development process, I want to examine
              how the UI and UX decisions I made throughout influenced my
              technical implementation. By analysing the relationship between my
              design choices and code structure, I can identify what worked well
              and what I could improve in creating an accessible, maintainable,
              and user-centered digital experience.
            </p>

            <h3>My Folder Structure</h3>
            <p>
              I structured my folders to mirror how I wanted users to navigate
              my content. Each major section I created, blog, design, essay,
              portfolio, profile, has its own directory, which directly reflects
              the primary navigation I built for users. This helped me maintain
              a logical connection between how users think about my site and how
              I organised the files. I'm particularly proud of how I organised
              my blog section. I gave each blog post its own subdirectory
              (blogone, blogtwo, etc.), making it intuitive for both users and
              me to understand the relationships between different pieces of
              content and maintain my codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
              I maintained a clear separation between my three main layers. My
              data layer consists of HTML, where I structured my content and
              semantic markup. My presentation layer includes my styling,
              organised in dedicated CSS files like main.css, blog.css, and
              essay.css. My logic layer contains interactive functionality that
              I separated into script.js, essay_filter.js, and
              portfolio_filter.js among others. This separation makes my code
              much easier to maintain and allows me to update modules without
              breaking other parts of my site.
            </p>

            <p>
              My folder structure reflects good modularity and allows for
              scalability, which makes any plans of upscaling the website
              relatively simple, as I can keep track of all my stuff more
              easily. I can maintain section-specific CSS files like blog.css
              and essay.css independently while sharing common styles through
              main.css. I followed consistent naming conventions that make my
              codebase scalable and intuitive for future development.
            </p>

            <p>
              I made sure my HTML markup gives browsers substantial context
              through proper semantic elements. I used
              <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
              <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and
              <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements to create a clear document
              structure that browsers and assistive technologies can interpret
              effectively. My blog and essay sections particularly benefit from
              this approach. I wrapped each post in
              <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements with proper heading
              hierarchies (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) and
              time elements with datetime attributes for publication dates.
            </p>

            <p>
              I expressed my interface elements through appropriate semantic
              HTML. My navigation uses proper <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and
              <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> structures to create a clear hierarchical
              understanding for both users and browsers. Interactive elements
              like my hamburger menu use proper button semantics to ensure
              accessibility and proper functionality. My filter system in the
              essay section uses semantic button elements with data attributes
              to maintain both functionality and semantic meaning. I structured
              my content with proper heading hierarchies, paragraph elements,
              and citation markup. I used <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> elements in
              my essays to provide semantic meaning to references, while
              <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements with datetime attributes give
              temporal context to my publications.
            </p>

            <p>
              My semantic markup significantly improves accessibility by
              providing screen readers with proper document structure through
              semantic elements, creating logical tab order through proper HTML
              structure, enabling skip navigation through clear content
              organisation, and supporting assistive technologies with
              meaningful element roles. However, I recognise areas where I could
              improve, particularly in providing more comprehensive alt text for
              images and ensuring all my interactive elements have proper focus
              indicators.
            </p>

            <h3>Guiding Browsers</h3>
            <p>
              My website includes essential metadata in the
              <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> sections:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Character encoding (<code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>)
              </li>
              <li>Viewport settings for responsive design</li>
              <li>Page descriptions for SEO and accessibility</li>
              <li>Proper title elements for each page</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I properly identified and implemented metadata for content that
              needed it. I included publication dates with structured datetime
              attributes to provide temporal context. I added author information
              with microformat classes like h-card and p-author to establish
              clear authorship. I used content type identification through
              microformat classes such as h-entry and e-content to help machines
              understand the structure and purpose of my content.
            </p>

            <p>
              I implemented microformats effectively in my blog and essay
              sections. I used h-entry for my blog posts and essays to establish
              them as individual entries, p-name for titles to identify content
              headings, dt-published for publication dates to provide temporal
              metadata, p-author h-card for author information to establish
              clear authorship, and e-content for main content areas to identify
              the primary content for each entry. This structured data enhances
              machine readability and supports future content syndication.
            </p>

            <p>
              I successfully avoided inline styles throughout my website, for
              the most part, handling all styling through external CSS files (I
              say for the most past as there was certain sections in my website
              where I was unsure of how to handle the styling externally). This
              creates consistency across my site and makes maintenance much
              easier for me. My modular approach with section-specific
              stylesheets (blog.css, essay.css) allows me to target specific
              styling while maintaining global consistency through main.css. My
              CSS architecture demonstrates the modularity I was aiming for. I
              keep shared styles in main.css for common elements that appear
              throughout the site. I maintain section-specific styles in
              dedicated files to allow for targeted customisation without
              affecting other areas. I use consistent naming conventions for
              classes to make the code intuitive and predictable. I create
              reusable component styles that can be applied across different
              sections when appropriate. This structure makes my codebase
              maintainable and allows me to easily update specific sections
              without affecting others.
            </p>

            <p>
              I included responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
              through a mobile-first design approach with appropriate media
              queries. I implemented flexible grid systems for content layout
              that adjust naturally to different viewport sizes. I created
              responsive navigation with a hamburger menu for mobile devices to
              ensure usability across all screen sizes. I used fluid typography
              that scales appropriately across devices to maintain readability
              and visual hierarchy. My responsive design ensures accessibility
              across different devices and viewing contexts, supporting the
              inclusive design principles I learned in the course.
            </p>

            <p>
              I properly implemented JavaScript functionality through event
              handlers and DOM manipulation. I created mobile menu toggle
              functionality through my toggleMobileMenu() function to ensure
              smooth navigation across devices. I built an essay filtering
              system through dedicated script files that allows users to sort
              content dynamically. I implemented smooth scrolling and
              interactive elements to enhance the user experience. I added
              back-to-top button functionality to improve navigation on longer
              pages. My JavaScript demonstrates good practices in consolidating
              repeated functionality. I maintain shared utility functions in
              script.js that I use across multiple pages to avoid code
              duplication. I separate specialised functionality like essay
              filtering into dedicated files to keep code organised and
              maintainable. I use consistent event handling patterns throughout
              the site to create predictable and reliable interactions. I
              properly avoided inline scripting, linking all my JavaScript
              through external files using the defer attribute for optimal
              loading performance. This approach improves maintainability and
              allows for better caching strategies.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also recognise that more extensive JavaScript could've been used
              throughout the site, but I found that coming up with a playful
              design in that respect quite challenging without causing it to
              deviate from the overall experience I wanted to create. The
              implementation I went for merely served to highlight my interests
              in Pokémon and thus lacked any real interaction elements aside
              from people who share the same interests as me, but in the context
              of my design philosophy, I'd say I did a good enough job. While my
              current implementation works well, I recognise opportunities for
              improvement in async requests and performance optimisation. The
              script I used was fairly straightforward and didn't deviate too
              much from the tutorial video I followed along with. The static
              nature of my current site means most content loads synchronously,
              but future enhancements could benefit from dynamic content loading
              for improved user experience.
            </p>

            <h3>How Design Drove My Technical Decisions</h3>
            <p>
              My user experience design directly influenced several technical
              implementations:
            </p>

            <p>
              Content Filtering: My desire to allow users to easily navigate
              between different essays led me to implement JavaScript-based
              filtering, requiring careful consideration of semantic markup and
              accessible interaction patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
              Responsive Navigation: My need for a consistent navigation
              experience across devices resulted in implementing a hamburger
              menu system that maintains accessibility while adapting to
              different screen sizes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Content Hierarchy: My emphasis on readable, academic content
              influenced my semantic markup structure, with proper heading
              hierarchies and citation formatting.
            </p>

            <h3>How I Integrated Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              My focus on inclusive design throughout the course directly
              impacted my code structure. Something that struck throughout my
              lectures was that we should not be designing things without the
              input of the end user in mind, and although a small test group, I
              did get a few of my family members to go through my website and
              take a look for accessibility pointers I could lean on. For
              instance, the menu blurring out the background, although a minor
              thing, was suggested so that they could concentrate on the menu
              content exclusively when it's opened, as that was what they were
              used to when navigating through other sites. In terms of screen
              readers I did my best to describe what was contained inside images
              as difficult as it was for me to put into words, which put into
              perspective how much I take my clear eyesight for granted as I do
              not think that much about what I see when looking at a picture as
              much as I do 'see'. Reflecting on my implementation, I see several
              areas I could enhance. Enhanced accessibility would benefit from
              adding more comprehensive ARIA labels, improving focus indicators,
              and ensuring all my interactive elements are properly announced to
              screen readers. Performance optimisation could include
              implementing lazy loading for images, optimising CSS delivery, and
              considering progressive enhancement strategies. Error handling
              improvements would involve adding more robust error handling in my
              JavaScript to ensure graceful degradation. Progressive enhancement
              would ensure all functionality works without JavaScript, then
              enhance with interactive features for users who have it enabled.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              My implementation of this website demonstrates how UI and UX
              decisions directly influence technical implementation. My semantic
              markup, modular CSS architecture, and thoughtful JavaScript
              implementation all serve my goal of creating an accessible,
              maintainable, and user-centered digital experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              My separation of concerns, proper semantic markup, and responsive
              design principles create a foundation that supports both current
              usability needs and future scalability. While I have areas for
              improvement, particularly in advanced accessibility features and
              performance optimisation, my current implementation successfully
              translates my design intentions into functional, accessible code.
              This reflection reinforces for me the importance of considering
              accessibility, maintainability, and user experience from the
              earliest stages of development, as these considerations
              fundamentally shape the technical architecture of the final
              product. My integration of inclusive design principles with
              technical implementation creates a more robust and ethically
              responsible digital presence. Below I've attached a few videos
              which helped me along the way, I hope they help you too!
