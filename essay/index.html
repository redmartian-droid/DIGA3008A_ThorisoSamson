            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              While first going through the 24BitGameStudio website, I initially
              considered its general design elements, i.e., the font size
              consistency, the purposeful utilisation of background colors to
              direct users' attention, and the chromatic equilibrium that
              accompanies their brand identity. A more critical inspection of
              the site through the lens of web accessibility and ethical user
              experience design principles, however, revealed several points
              that merit further discussion. Website accessibility should not be
              treated as a compliance matter alone; rather, it is a core
              commitment to inclusive design that addresses the needs of all
              users with or without disabilities. This essay aims to assess the
              24BitGameStudio website's performance based on standard
              accessibility guidelines and ethical user experience frameworks.
            </p>

            <h2>Visual Design Elements</h2>
            <p>
              The 24BitGameStudio website demonstrates thoughtful attention to
              visual design, particularly in its consistent use of brand colors.
              The background colors effectively differentiate sections and guide
              the user's visual flow through the content. The navbar buttons
              also provide interactive feedback, changing color upon hover
              (glowing blue) and when pressed (turning red), the latter of which
              also indicates to the user what page they are on, which provides
              clear visual feedback, which enhances user interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the color coordination with the logo fosters a streamlined
              visual experience, this does not necessarily guarantee
              accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies or low
              vision. The website primarily uses hues of blue, red, white, and
              dark grey. Although these colors can be visually striking, they
              may still present challenges if used without adequate contrast or
              if critical information is conveyed through color alone. For
              example, users with red-green color blindness, a common form of
              color vision deficiency, may struggle to distinguish between
              certain shades of red and grey.
            </p>
            <p>
              A notable accessibility issue concerns the site's interactive
              elements. While navbar buttons change color when hovered or
              clicked, standard buttons and form elements lack visual feedback
              for interaction states. This absence of clear focus indicators
              violates accessibility best practices and creates significant
              barriers for keyboard users, particularly those with motor
              disabilities who can't use a mouse. Without visible indicators
              showing their current location during keyboard navigation, these
              users face unnecessary difficulties interacting with the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I observed inconsistencies in typography across the
              website, particularly in the use of capitalisation. For example,
              the contact page features text that is written entirely in
              uppercase letters, in contrast to the rest of the site, excluding
              the game preview section, which predominantly uses standard
              sentence case (capitalised first letters followed by lowercase).
              While the use of all caps may have been intended to create
              emphasis, such typographic inconsistency can introduce cognitive
              friction for users. This is especially true for individuals with
              cognitive disabilities, who benefit from uniform and predictable
              visual patterns. All-caps text can also reduce readability, as it
              disrupts the familiar shapes of words that readers rely on for
              quick recognition. I found myself suffering from that as well
              since I find familiarity comforting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite this issue, the website maintains legible font sizes
              across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms, demonstrating an
              understanding of responsive design principles. This adaptability
              is important for accessibility, ensuring that text remains
              readable across various devices and screen dimensions.
            </p>

            <h2>Content and Information Structure</h2>
            <p>
              A critical aspect of my accessibility testing involved using a
              screen reader to navigate the 24BitGameStudio website, where I
              encountered significant barriers related to image accessibility.
              While using Microsoft Edge's immersive screen reader mode, I found
              that images across the site were not being read aloud, posing a
              substantial accessibility issue for visually impaired users who
              rely on screen readers to access content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon further inspection with developer tools, I noted that the
              images, particularly in the service and client sections, were
              named using generic filenames such as "service1," "service2," and
              "client1." This naming convention introduces two primary
              accessibility concerns:
            </p>
            <p>
              First, even if the screen reader were properly configured, these
              generic names offer no meaningful description of the image
              content. For instance, a user might hear "client1" without
              understanding which client the image represents or what the image
              itself depicts. This lack of descriptive alt text directly
              contradicts Vaidya's (2020) assertion that "the alternative text
              for each image must convey the meaning the image is intended to
              communicate, not merely describe what the image looks like."
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, the failure to announce images in screen reader mode
              suggests possible technical issues in the website's
              implementation, such as missing alt attributes, improper ARIA
              roles, or problems with the HTML structure. According to Vaidya
              (2020), "alternative text is not required for decorative images,"
              but logos and service illustrations carry meaningful information
              and should be described appropriately to accommodate non-visual
              users. The lack of these descriptions further compounds the
              accessibility barriers that visually impaired users face.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also encountered a significant navigation barrier on the
              home/about page. When activating the immersive screen reader mode,
              the page is simplified visually, presumably to enhance
              readability. However, this simplified version removed navigation
              options, effectively trapping users on the page. As I noted during
              testing, "When simplified, I cannot navigate to any other page.
              When I exit this immersive screen reader mode, I can navigate
              freely to other pages." This restricted experience violates core
              principles of accessible design, which emphasise providing equal
              access for all users, regardless of their method of interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, I found that the 'read aloud' feature on other pages
              did not support image descriptions, creating an inconsistent user
              experience. As I observed, I cannot activate the immersive screen
              reader on those pages; instead, I can click on 'read aloud,' which
              does not account for images. This inconsistency highlights
              potential issues with the semantic structure of the website.
              Proper semantic HTML is essential for screen reader compatibility,
              as it informs assistive technologies how to interpret and navigate
              content. Vaidya (2020) emphasises that "headings must be
              structured appropriately in the design specifications. Skipping
              heading levels is not recommended, as it disrupts the structure."
              Without a consistent heading hierarchy and semantic markup, screen
              readers cannot effectively communicate the organisation of
              content, making navigation difficult.
            </p>

            <h3>Dynamic Content Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              The inconsistent behavior between pages, where only the home/about
              page changes its presentation in screen reader mode, suggests
              uneven implementation of accessibility features. Such
              inconsistencies can be particularly challenging for users with
              cognitive disabilities, who benefit from predictable patterns and
              consistent behaviors. Moreover, the 24BitGameStudio website
              features a section where client logos scroll horizontally in a
              carousel format. While visually engaging, this dynamic content
              presents several accessibility challenges. The images in the
              carousel are generically named (e.g., "client1"), which fails to
              provide meaningful information to screen reader users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vaidya (2020) specifically addresses this issue, noting that "the
              user should be given control to stop, pause, or hide any content
              or information that appears on the interface that moves, blinks,
              or scrolls." During my testing, I did not observe any controls
              that would allow users to pause or control the carousel's
              movement, suggesting non-compliance with this important
              accessibility guideline.
            </p>

            <h3>Form Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              The contact page features forms for user input, which present
              their own set of accessibility considerations. While the slightly
              larger font size on this page might enhance readability for some
              users, other aspects of form accessibility require evaluation. For
              forms to be fully accessible, they should include properly
              associated labels, clear instructions, indication of required
              fields, and accessible error validation that doesn't rely solely
              on color to convey meaning. As Vaidya (2020) notes, "It is not a
              good practice to alert the user when there is an error by just
              changing the labels of a form to red color. Color should not be
              used as the only means to indicate an action in an interface."
            </p>
            <p>
              The 24BitGameStudio form does just that; however, the font size of
              the text indicator for error validation, as well as its color
              choice, makes it hard to read and a bit difficult to focus on.
              There also seems to be a strange inconsistency regarding the
              headings' color choice and that of the error validation, both are
              red; however, the former is a brighter hue that contrasts well
              against the background, while the other is a duller shade, which
              leads to the accessibility issues noted earlier.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              While analysing, I came across a curious choice regarding the data
              collection practices on the 24BitGameStudio website. The site
              collects extensive personal information, including identifying,
              contact, and demographic data, albeit for people or clients
              seeking more information through their contact section. Despite
              this comprehensive data gathering, the website lacks a cookie
              policy, raising significant ethical concerns regarding informed
              consent and transparency (Brignull, H., Leiser, M., Santos, C.,
              and Doshi, K., 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
              As Geyser (n.d. a) argues, ethical web design must prioritise
              "Privacy," "Transparency," and "Ethical Persuasion". This absence
              of cookie notifications particularly affects users from regions
              with strict privacy regulations like the EU, where GDPR mandates
              explicit consent. While omitting such notices might create a
              smoother user experience, it compromises ethical standards.
              Through the lens of "Design Justice" (Costanza-Chock, 2020;
              Geyser, n.d. b), this represents a problematic power imbalance
              between the website owner's extensive data collection and users'
              limited awareness, potentially violating ethical design
              principles.
            </p>

            <h2>User Experience and Interface Design</h2>
            <p>
              While the 24BitGameStudio website does not display overt cultural
              insensitivity, it lacks consideration for local usability in a
              South African context. The site is exclusively in English, which,
              while commonly used in business, is only the fourth most spoken
              language in the country, spoken by roughly 9% of the population.
              More widely spoken languages like Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans are
              notably absent, as are the remaining official languages of South
              Africa. Although users can rely on third-party translation tools,
              the absence of built-in multilingual support may be perceived as
              tone-deaf or exclusionary, especially given the country's
              linguistic diversity and constitutional commitment to language
              equity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their website maintains visual consistency across most pages,
              which should, in theory, support a predictable user experience.
              Font sizes for headings and paragraph text are consistent, and the
              layout adapts well across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
              Additionally, the use of different background colors to
              distinguish sections effectively supports visual hierarchy and
              guides the user's eye, helping to emphasise important content.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this visual consistency is undermined by significant
              inconsistencies in accessibility, particularly in how the site
              behaves with assistive technologies. Screen reader testing
              revealed that only the about page adapts its presentation in
              reader mode, while other pages remain unchanged. This creates an
              unpredictable and potentially frustrating experience for users
              relying on screen readers. Predictable navigation and consistent
              behavior are especially critical for users with cognitive
              disabilities or those unfamiliar with web conventions. As Vaidya
              (2020) emphasises, information architecture should prioritise
              accessibility for elderly users and those with cognitive
              challenges, with features like always-visible menus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, while visual cues like background colors help with
              organisation, they must be supported by proper semantic structure
              in the code. The inconsistencies uncovered in screen reader
              performance suggest that this underlying structure may not be
              fully accessible or well-implemented.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              This analysis reveals that the site's UI, UX, and IxD suffer from
              not only technical oversights but also critical ethical failings.
              The inconsistent support for assistive technologies, lack of focus
              indicators, and segregated immersive reader experience demonstrate
              a disregard for inclusive design, effectively marginalising users
              with disabilities. These are not isolated design flaws, they
              reflect broader systemic neglect of accessibility as a core value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Equally troubling is the lack of data transparency, with missing
              cookie policies and unclear consent mechanisms compromising user
              autonomy and trust (Geyser, n.d. a). Ethical UX requires respect
              for user agency and informed consent, both of which are undermined
              here.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Vaidya (2020) asserts, accessibility and inclusion should not
              be retrofitted but rather integrated into design from its earliest
              stages. The failure to do so in this case exemplifies a broader
              systemic issue in digital design, where accessibility is often
              deprioritised in favor of aesthetic or commercial goals. This
              neglect not only reinforces existing power imbalances, excluding
              those with less access or fewer abilities, but also contradicts
              the foundational ideals of user-centered design.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The digital age has presented unprecedented opportunities for
              global connectivity and information sharing, yet it has also
              contributed to the creation of new forms of colonial power
              structures that mirror historical patterns of domination and
              exploitation. Digital colonialism, as defined by Coleman (2018),
              represents "a modern-day 'Scramble for Africa' where large-scale
              tech companies extract, analyse, and own user data for profit and
              market influence with nominal benefit to the data source." This
              essay examines how Western-controlled social media platforms
              enable the systematic spread of misinformation about the Global
              South, using the recent case of Elon Musk's amplification of
              "white genocide" conspiracy theories about South Africa as a
              critical lens. The incident, which reached its peak in 2024-2025,
              demonstrates how digital colonial structures not only extract data
              and profits from African users but also impose harmful narratives
              that serve Western political interests while silencing African
              voices.
            </p>

            <h2>Theoretical Framework: Understanding Digital Colonialism</h2>
            <p>
              Digital colonialism extends past economic exploitation to
              encompass what can be termed "epistemic violence" - the systematic
              marginalisation and delegitimisation of non-Western ways of
              knowing and being. As noted in a recent scholarship, "digital
              colonialism—the systemic extraction and commodification of
              marginalised cultures through digital platforms, where those with
              privilege can claim ownership over traditions while the original
              communities lose control of their narratives" (OpenGlobalRights,
              n.d.). This framework is particularly relevant when examining how
              Western-owned platforms like X (formerly Twitter) become vehicles
              for spreading misinformation about African realities, despite the
              platform being owned by a South African ironically enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kwame Nkrumah's concept of neo-colonialism, which describes the
              practice of using economic, political, or cultural influence
              rather than direct military force to control former colonies,
              finds new expression in the digital age. Social media platforms,
              predominantly owned and operated by Western corporations, create
              algorithmic architectures that privilege certain voices while
              marginalising others, effectively recreating colonial hierarchies
              in digital spaces.
            </p>

            <p>
              Elon Musk's sustained campaign to promote "white genocide"
              conspiracy theories about South Africa represents a paradigmatic
              example of digital colonialism in action. Beginning with renewed
              intensity in 2023 and continuing through 2025, Musk leveraged his
              massive following of over 200 million users on X to spread
              demonstrably false claims about systematic violence against white
              South Africans (The Washington Post 2023). "They are openly
              pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa," Musk
              tweeted, before asking why South African President Cyril Ramaphosa
              had said "nothing" about the incident (The Washington Post, 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
              The factual reality contradicts these claims. South African police
              recorded 26,232 murders nationwide in 2024, of which 44 were
              linked to farming communities (NBC News, 2025). Most murder
              victims in South Africa are Black, not white, and a South African
              court determined in February that claims of a white genocide in
              the country are not true (Reuters, 2025). Yet despite these facts
              being readily available and extensively documented by South
              African institutions and journalists, Musk's misinformation gained
              significant traction, even influencing U.S. foreign policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The colonial nature of this misinformation campaign becomes
              evident when examining its impact. Former President Donald Trump,
              influenced by these false narratives, offered asylum to white
              South Africans and maintained these positions even when directly
              confronted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (Fortune,
              2025). During a recent meeting, Trump continued to push the
              baseless conspiracy theory even with South Africa's president
              present to refute it directly (Fortune, 2025). This represents a
              form of epistemic violence where Western figures claim authority
              over African realities, dismissing the knowledge and lived
              experiences of Africans themselves.
            </p>

            <h2>Algorithmic Colonialism and Platform Bias</h2>
            <p>
              The structural inequalities inherent in Western-controlled social
              media platforms became startlingly apparent in how Musk's
              misinformation was amplified while South African
              counter-narratives were marginalised. Despite numerous South
              Africans, including white South Africans, actively refuting these
              claims on the platform, their voices were systematically
              diminished by algorithmic biases that prioritise engagement
              metrics over truth or local expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
              X's algorithm prioritises accounts with large followings and high
              engagement rates, creating what can be termed "algorithmic
              colonialism", a system where Western voices are structurally
              advantaged over those from the Global South, this is despite
              Musk's own claims that the algorithm would boost smaller accounts
              to counter such biases . Lutz (2019) identifies this as part of
              the third-level digital divide, where disparities in outcomes
              emerge even when access and usage are similar. Western users with
              higher digital capital can translate engagement into influence,
              while Global South users face structural disadvantages in shaping
              discourse. This technological bias enabled Musk's false claims to
              reach millions while South African fact-checkers, journalists, and
              ordinary citizens struggled to gain visibility for accurate
              information about their own country.
            </p>
            <p>
              The community notes feature, ostensibly designed to combat
              misinformation, proved inadequate in this context. Ironically,
              even Musk's own AI chatbot Grok contradicted his claims, noting
              that "No trustworthy sources back Elon Musk's 'white genocide'
              claim in South Africa; courts dismiss it as unfounded" (NBC News,
              2025). However, the structural power imbalances on the platform
              meant that this correction had minimal impact compared to the
              original misinformation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The absence of widely used, African-controlled social media
              platforms that could provide alternative spaces for African
              narratives is something that can no longer be ignored. While
              countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal have
              initiated local digital media platforms, these applications
              reflect the South's ability to offer successful models based on
              the interests and priorities of their people, free from Western
              control. However, these platforms lack the global reach and
              influence of Western-controlled social media giants.
            </p>
            <p>
              This digital dependency creates what Frantz Fanon might have
              recognised as a form of psychological colonialism, where Africans
              are forced to contest representations of themselves on platforms
              owned and controlled by their former colonisers. The inability to
              control the technological infrastructure through which global
              conversations about Africa occur represents a fundamental form of
              digital subjugation.
            </p>

            <h2>The Role of Technology in Perpetuating Colonial Narratives</h2>
            <p>
              The recent revelation that Musk's chatbot Grok keeps bringing up
              false claims about 'white genocide' in South Africa unprompted
              demonstrates how colonial biases become embedded in artificial
              intelligence systems (Rolling Stone, 2025). This technological
              amplification of misinformation represents a new frontier in
              digital colonialism, where AI systems trained on biased data
              reproduce and amplify harmful stereotypes about the Global South.
            </p>
            <p>
              The digital space has demonstrated considerable bias, particularly
              through the democratisation of AI programming, which has resulted
              in explicit racism and sexism becoming ingrained in many AI
              platforms (Slate, 2025). In the case of Grok's obsession with
              "white genocide" narratives, we see how these biases manifest in
              concrete harm to African communities and international relations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The international ramifications of Musk's misinformation campaign
              reveal how digital colonialism intersects with traditional
              geopolitical power structures. The fact that false narratives
              propagated on a Western-owned platform could influence U.S.
              foreign policy toward South Africa demonstrates the continued
              salience of colonial relationships in the digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
              The situation escalated to the point where President Donald Trump
              maintained his false beliefs about South African "white genocide"
              even when directly confronted by President Ramaphosa with factual
              information (Reuters, 2025). This represents a direct material
              consequence of digital colonial violence, where misinformation
              spread through Western-controlled platforms translates into
              concrete diplomatic tensions and potential economic harm for
              African nations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite the structural disadvantages, South African resistance to
              these false narratives provides important insights into potential
              strategies for digital decolonisation. The coordinated efforts by
              South African social media users to counter Musk's misinformation,
              while ultimately limited by algorithmic biases, demonstrate the
              possibility of grassroots resistance within colonial digital
              structures.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, these efforts also highlight the inadequacy of individual
              resistance in the face of structural inequalities. As Shahid
              (2024) notes, "Around 75% of Internet users are from non-English
              speaking countries in the Majority World (i.e., Global South). Yet
              social media companies allocate most of their content moderation
              resources to English speaking populations in the West." This
              disparity in content moderation resources meant that harmful
              misinformation about South Africa received insufficient attention
              from platform moderators.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Musk misinformation case underscores the urgent need for what
              might be termed "digital sovereignty" - the ability of nations and
              communities in the Global South to control the technological
              infrastructure through which narratives about them are constructed
              and disseminated. This involves not just creating alternative
              platforms but developing entirely different models of digital
              interaction that prioritise truth, community well-being, and
              cultural authenticity over engagement metrics and profit
              maximisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              As noted by digital rights advocates, "As Big Tech's data and
              profit extraction extends the world over, activists in the Global
              South are pointing the way to a more just digital future"
              (OpenGlobalRights, n.d.). These efforts must be supported and
              scaled to challenge the current digital colonial order.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The case of Elon Musk's amplification of "white genocide"
              misinformation about South Africa represents a paradigmatic
              example of digital colonialism in the contemporary era. Through
              his control of a major social media platform and his massive
              following, Musk was able to impose false narratives about African
              realities that influenced international relations and policy,
              despite consistent refutation by South Africans themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              This incident reveals how digital colonial structures operate
              through algorithmic biases, unequal resource allocation, and the
              systematic privileging of Western voices over Global South
              perspectives. The inability of South Africans to effectively
              counter these narratives on a platform owned by their former
              colonial powers demonstrates the continued salience of colonial
              relationships in digital spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward, the development of African-controlled digital
              platforms and the establishment of digital sovereignty frameworks
              will be crucial for challenging these colonial structures. Only
              through such efforts can the Global South begin to reclaim control
              over the narratives that shape international perceptions and
              policies regarding their societies. The fight against digital
              colonialism is not merely a technological challenge but a
              fundamental struggle for epistemic justice and the right of all
              peoples to define themselves in the digital age.
            </p>
