          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            While first going through the 24BitGameStudio website, I initially
            considered its general design elements, i.e., the font size
            consistency, the purposeful utilisation of background colors to
            direct users' attention, and the chromatic equilibrium that
            accompanies their brand identity. A more critical inspection of the
            site through the lens of web accessibility and ethical user
            experience design principles, however, revealed several points that
            merit further discussion. Website accessibility should not be
            treated as a compliance matter alone; rather, it is a core
            commitment to inclusive design that addresses the needs of all users
            with or without disabilities. This essay aims to assess the
            24BitGameStudio website's performance based on standard
            accessibility guidelines and ethical user experience frameworks.
          </p>

          <h2>Visual Design Elements</h2>
          <p>
            The 24BitGameStudio website demonstrates thoughtful attention to
            visual design, particularly in its consistent use of brand colors.
            The background colors effectively differentiate sections and guide
            the user's visual flow through the content. The navbar buttons also
            provide interactive feedback, changing color upon hover (glowing
            blue) and when pressed (turning red), the latter of which also
            indicates to the user what page they are on, which provides clear
            visual feedback, which enhances user interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the color coordination with the logo fosters a streamlined
            visual experience, this does not necessarily guarantee accessibility
            for users with color vision deficiencies or low vision. The website
            primarily uses hues of blue, red, white, and dark grey. Although
            these colors can be visually striking, they may still present
            challenges if used without adequate contrast or if critical
            information is conveyed through color alone. For example, users with
            red-green color blindness, a common form of color vision deficiency,
            may struggle to distinguish between certain shades of red and grey.
          </p>
          <p>
            A notable accessibility issue concerns the site's interactive
            elements. While navbar buttons change color when hovered or clicked,
            standard buttons and form elements lack visual feedback for
            interaction states. This absence of clear focus indicators violates
            accessibility best practices and creates significant barriers for
            keyboard users, particularly those with motor disabilities who can't
            use a mouse. Without visible indicators showing their current
            location during keyboard navigation, these users face unnecessary
            difficulties interacting with the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I observed inconsistencies in typography across the
            website, particularly in the use of capitalisation. For example, the
            contact page features text that is written entirely in uppercase
            letters, in contrast to the rest of the site, excluding the game
            preview section, which predominantly uses standard sentence case
            (capitalised first letters followed by lowercase). While the use of
            all caps may have been intended to create emphasis, such typographic
            inconsistency can introduce cognitive friction for users. This is
            especially true for individuals with cognitive disabilities, who
            benefit from uniform and predictable visual patterns. All-caps text
            can also reduce readability, as it disrupts the familiar shapes of
            words that readers rely on for quick recognition. I found myself
            suffering from that as well since I find familiarity comforting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this issue, the website maintains legible font sizes across
            desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms, demonstrating an
            understanding of responsive design principles. This adaptability is
            important for accessibility, ensuring that text remains readable
            across various devices and screen dimensions.
          </p>

          <h2>Content and Information Structure</h2>
          <p>
            A critical aspect of my accessibility testing involved using a
            screen reader to navigate the 24BitGameStudio website, where I
            encountered significant barriers related to image accessibility.
            While using Microsoft Edge's immersive screen reader mode, I found
            that images across the site were not being read aloud, posing a
            substantial accessibility issue for visually impaired users who rely
            on screen readers to access content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon further inspection with developer tools, I noted that the
            images, particularly in the service and client sections, were named
            using generic filenames such as "service1," "service2," and
            "client1." This naming convention introduces two primary
            accessibility concerns:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, even if the screen reader were properly configured, these
            generic names offer no meaningful description of the image content.
            For instance, a user might hear "client1" without understanding
            which client the image represents or what the image itself depicts.
            This lack of descriptive alt text directly contradicts Vaidya's
            (2020) assertion that "the alternative text for each image must
            convey the meaning the image is intended to communicate, not merely
            describe what the image looks like."
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, the failure to announce images in screen reader mode
            suggests possible technical issues in the website's implementation,
            such as missing alt attributes, improper ARIA roles, or problems
            with the HTML structure. According to Vaidya (2020), "alternative
            text is not required for decorative images," but logos and service
            illustrations carry meaningful information and should be described
            appropriately to accommodate non-visual users. The lack of these
            descriptions further compounds the accessibility barriers that
            visually impaired users face.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also encountered a significant navigation barrier on the
            home/about page. When activating the immersive screen reader mode,
            the page is simplified visually, presumably to enhance readability.
            However, this simplified version removed navigation options,
            effectively trapping users on the page. As I noted during testing,
            "When simplified, I cannot navigate to any other page. When I exit
            this immersive screen reader mode, I can navigate freely to other
            pages." This restricted experience violates core principles of
            accessible design, which emphasise providing equal access for all
            users, regardless of their method of interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, I found that the 'read aloud' feature on other pages
            did not support image descriptions, creating an inconsistent user
            experience. As I observed, I cannot activate the immersive screen
            reader on those pages; instead, I can click on 'read aloud,' which
            does not account for images. This inconsistency highlights potential
            issues with the semantic structure of the website. Proper semantic
            HTML is essential for screen reader compatibility, as it informs
            assistive technologies how to interpret and navigate content. Vaidya
            (2020) emphasises that "headings must be structured appropriately in
            the design specifications. Skipping heading levels is not
            recommended, as it disrupts the structure." Without a consistent
            heading hierarchy and semantic markup, screen readers cannot
            effectively communicate the organisation of content, making
            navigation difficult.
          </p>

          <h3>Dynamic Content Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            The inconsistent behavior between pages, where only the home/about
            page changes its presentation in screen reader mode, suggests uneven
            implementation of accessibility features. Such inconsistencies can
            be particularly challenging for users with cognitive disabilities,
            who benefit from predictable patterns and consistent behaviors.
            Moreover, the 24BitGameStudio website features a section where
            client logos scroll horizontally in a carousel format. While
            visually engaging, this dynamic content presents several
            accessibility challenges. The images in the carousel are generically
            named (e.g., "client1"), which fails to provide meaningful
            information to screen reader users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vaidya (2020) specifically addresses this issue, noting that "the
            user should be given control to stop, pause, or hide any content or
            information that appears on the interface that moves, blinks, or
            scrolls." During my testing, I did not observe any controls that
            would allow users to pause or control the carousel's movement,
            suggesting non-compliance with this important accessibility
            guideline.
          </p>

          <h3>Form Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            The contact page features forms for user input, which present their
            own set of accessibility considerations. While the slightly larger
            font size on this page might enhance readability for some users,
            other aspects of form accessibility require evaluation. For forms to
            be fully accessible, they should include properly associated labels,
            clear instructions, indication of required fields, and accessible
            error validation that doesn't rely solely on color to convey
            meaning. As Vaidya (2020) notes, "It is not a good practice to alert
            the user when there is an error by just changing the labels of a
            form to red color. Color should not be used as the only means to
            indicate an action in an interface."
          </p>
          <p>
            The 24BitGameStudio form does just that; however, the font size of
            the text indicator for error validation, as well as its color
            choice, makes it hard to read and a bit difficult to focus on. There
            also seems to be a strange inconsistency regarding the headings'
            color choice and that of the error validation, both are red;
            however, the former is a brighter hue that contrasts well against
            the background, while the other is a duller shade, which leads to
            the accessibility issues noted earlier.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            While analysing, I came across a curious choice regarding the data
            collection practices on the 24BitGameStudio website. The site
            collects extensive personal information, including identifying,
            contact, and demographic data, albeit for people or clients seeking
            more information through their contact section. Despite this
            comprehensive data gathering, the website lacks a cookie policy,
            raising significant ethical concerns regarding informed consent and
            transparency (Brignull, H., Leiser, M., Santos, C., and Doshi, K.,
            2023).
          </p>
          <p>
            As Geyser (n.d. a) argues, ethical web design must prioritise
            "Privacy," "Transparency," and "Ethical Persuasion". This absence of
            cookie notifications particularly affects users from regions with
            strict privacy regulations like the EU, where GDPR mandates explicit
            consent. While omitting such notices might create a smoother user
            experience, it compromises ethical standards. Through the lens of
            "Design Justice" (Costanza-Chock, 2020; Geyser, n.d. b), this
            represents a problematic power imbalance between the website owner's
            extensive data collection and users' limited awareness, potentially
            violating ethical design principles.
          </p>

          <h2>User Experience and Interface Design</h2>
          <p>
            While the 24BitGameStudio website does not display overt cultural
            insensitivity, it lacks consideration for local usability in a South
            African context. The site is exclusively in English, which, while
            commonly used in business, is only the fourth most spoken language
            in the country, spoken by roughly 9% of the population. More widely
            spoken languages like Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans are notably absent,
            as are the remaining official languages of South Africa. Although
            users can rely on third-party translation tools, the absence of
            built-in multilingual support may be perceived as tone-deaf or
            exclusionary, especially given the country's linguistic diversity
            and constitutional commitment to language equity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their website maintains visual consistency across most pages, which
            should, in theory, support a predictable user experience. Font sizes
            for headings and paragraph text are consistent, and the layout
            adapts well across desktop, tablet, and mobile views. Additionally,
            the use of different background colors to distinguish sections
            effectively supports visual hierarchy and guides the user's eye,
            helping to emphasise important content.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this visual consistency is undermined by significant
            inconsistencies in accessibility, particularly in how the site
            behaves with assistive technologies. Screen reader testing revealed
            that only the about page adapts its presentation in reader mode,
            while other pages remain unchanged. This creates an unpredictable
            and potentially frustrating experience for users relying on screen
            readers. Predictable navigation and consistent behavior are
            especially critical for users with cognitive disabilities or those
            unfamiliar with web conventions. As Vaidya (2020) emphasises,
            information architecture should prioritise accessibility for elderly
            users and those with cognitive challenges, with features like
            always-visible menus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, while visual cues like background colors help with
            organisation, they must be supported by proper semantic structure in
            the code. The inconsistencies uncovered in screen reader performance
            suggest that this underlying structure may not be fully accessible
            or well-implemented.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            This analysis reveals that the site's UI, UX, and IxD suffer from
            not only technical oversights but also critical ethical failings.
            The inconsistent support for assistive technologies, lack of focus
            indicators, and segregated immersive reader experience demonstrate a
            disregard for inclusive design, effectively marginalising users with
            disabilities. These are not isolated design flaws, they reflect
            broader systemic neglect of accessibility as a core value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Equally troubling is the lack of data transparency, with missing
            cookie policies and unclear consent mechanisms compromising user
            autonomy and trust (Geyser, n.d. a). Ethical UX requires respect for
            user agency and informed consent, both of which are undermined here.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Vaidya (2020) asserts, accessibility and inclusion should not be
            retrofitted but rather integrated into design from its earliest
            stages. The failure to do so in this case exemplifies a broader
            systemic issue in digital design, where accessibility is often
            deprioritised in favor of aesthetic or commercial goals. This
            neglect not only reinforces existing power imbalances, excluding
            those with less access or fewer abilities, but also contradicts the
            foundational ideals of user-centered design.
