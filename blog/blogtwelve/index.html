        <div class="e-content">
          <p>
            When thinking about how our code matters in decolonialism, I’ve
            realised in my own practice how much of coding is tied to English.
            Even though I speak English often, it’s not my first language, and
            yet, all my comments, all the syntax, and all the structure of code
            are in English. It’s not just the language itself, but the way HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and even documentation are built around a Western
            way of thinking. It makes it hard to imagine coding in a way that
            feels more personal or local, because the tools themselves aren’t
            built with that flexibility in mind. Even our website aesthetics
            here in South Africa tend to follow Western design, clean,
            minimalistic, very focused on whitespace, rather than something more
            culturally specific. Meanwhile, when I look at some Asian websites,
            they often have a completely different design logic: more packed,
            more vibrant, and shaped by their own language and cultural systems.
            It shows that having your alphabet and digital culture gives you
            more space to break from Western norms.<br />
            In terms of my development process, the changes I made to
            incorporate JavaScript were pretty simple, but meaningful. I added a
            back-to-top button, which helps with navigation on longer pages. I
            also included a slight animation for the drop-down menu to make
            things feel smoother and a filter button for my blog section, making
            it easier for people to find what they’re looking for. These small
            features made the interaction feel more dynamic and less static. It
            also gave me more control over how users move through the site,
            rather than just relying on static links or traditional scroll
            behavior. Even if it’s a small touch, it helps me shape a more
            fluid, intentional experience for the user, and that, in a way, is
            part of reclaiming some creative control. Not to mention it does
            help declutter the website in a way that doesn't feel too intrusive
            given the fact that the user still has the option to manually scroll
            to these sections, and this instead works as an optional
            functionality on the website that they can utilise should they so
            choose.

              appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai

              I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the
              screen without much interference. To further this I've made use of
              space and bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide
              them to page elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to
              curate what they see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls
              down the previously displayed text...<br /><a
