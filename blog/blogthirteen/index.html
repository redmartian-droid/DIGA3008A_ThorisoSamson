            An ethical internet, to me, looks like one where every country and
            culture has a real voice and presence, not just in using the
            internet, but in shaping what it is, how it works, and what gets
            shared. As it stands right now, a lot of the internet is dominated
            by Western audiences, platforms, and priorities. This means that the
            stories told, the knowledge shared, and even the values baked into
            websites and apps often come from a narrow slice of the world. As
            Laura Stein points out in “Speech Without Rights”, most of what we
            consider the “public” internet is actually controlled by private
            entities that decide who gets to speak and what gets heard. This
            helps explain why Western voices dominate, the platforms themselves
            are designed and owned by Western corporations, reinforcing their
            worldviews and filtering out others. For African voices to have a
            real presence, we need not just access, but rights to shape these
            spaces, something current legal frameworks and platform structures
            often deny, made even more difficult by international red tape and
            the distinction of each countries laws and regulations which make it
            difficult to impose any one group's polices on foreign entities.
            That’s not fair. The internet should reflect the full range of human
            experience, not just what’s popular or profitable in the West. This
            is especially true, seeing as how the internet shapes a lot of our
            day-to-day culture and opinions regarding certain topics.<br />
            A fair and ethical internet would give countries like those in
            Africa a sizable presence. That means people from those places get
            to decide how their cultures are represented, what gets shared, and
            how their voices are heard. If a community’s stories, ideas, or
            traditions are being posted online, the people from that community
            should have a say in how that happens. The recent Afrikaner exchange
            on social media is a good example of that, with Elon Musk sharing
            views that a lot of locals in the country did not agree with, and
            yet, because of his large platform and following, the country was
            unable to change the worldwide perspective much.<br />
            It also means shifting power. Not everything should be run by the
            same few companies or built on the same set of rules. And although X
            is far more equitable than most platforms, the problem persists, as
            the algorithm itself, along with the actual percentage of the
            country engaging on the platform, is still quite skewed towards a
            Western audience who may have their own built-in biases from their
            worldview, which may not reflect the economic, social, or political
            climate of the place they’re commentating on. An ethical internet
            would be decentralised, more locally grounded, and equally shaped by
            voices from all over the world. It would support content in local
            languages, reflect local values, and make space for the unique ways
            different cultures use and understand technology. In short, an
            ethical internet to me is one where everyone is heard, no one is
            erased, and no single group controls the narrative, at least not in
            its entirety. It would be an internet that belongs to all of us, not
            just to the ones with the most money or influence.

              I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the
              screen without much interference. To further this I've made use of
              space and bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide
              them to page elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to
              curate what they see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls
              down the previously displayed text...<br /><a
