          <h2>IxD Process</h2>
          As I read Nanjira Sambuli's op-ed on digital equity and Sasha
          Costanza-Chock's book on design justice, I agreed with the fundamental
          principles of inclusivity and representation, yet I could not help but
          want to push back against some of the assumptions, most egregiously
          the one about decelerating technological advancement in an effort to
          create space for ethical reflection. Personally, whereas ethics and
          inclusiveness are paramount, the concept of slowing down or stopping
          is not only unrealistic but potentially harmful to a globalized
          setting, whereby technology does not wait for policy.<br />
          Sambuli is right to criticise the "build it and they will come" ethos,
          too often, technologies are constructed without consideration of the
          communities for which they are intended. This results in technology
          that can be used on paper but not in reality, especially for people
          with disabilities or in the Global South. Similarly, Costanza-Chock's
          argument that design is never neutral but rather leans toward dominant
          perspectives speaks deeply to this. For instance, companies that
          design cookie management systems will obscure the reject button,
          prioritising data collection and profit over user autonomy and
          transparency. Both authors tease out how power dynamics and profit
          motives become embedded in our online existence, often to the
          detriment of marginalised users.<br />
          Where I disagree with Sambuli, however, is in the implication that we
          need to slow down the introduction of new technologies to get it all
          "right" ethically. In the globalized world of today, this is not
          realistic. Nations such as China are forging ahead with AI with
          virtually no ethical brakes. If other nations, such as the U.S., wait
          and ponder while others act, it creates an uneven playing field that
          will lead to a global imbalance of technological prowess and know-how.
          Technology does not halt at borders anymore; a loss of time by one
          nation is another country's gain. That being written, while I disagree
          with slowing the rate of technological progress as an overall
          strategy, I do think we must go out of our way to involve marginalized
          voices from the very beginning. The longer we wait, the more time and
          effort we'll spend trying to retrofit answers and undo wrongs that
          could have been prevented by designing inclusively in the first
          place.<br />
          Integration after the fact is normally harder, more costly, and less
          successful than constructing with everybody in mind in the first
          place. Eventually, what I believe both authors end up alluding to,
          whether intentionally or unintentionally and I could be
          misinterpreting their wording here, is that ethics, justice, and
          innovation must be thought of as holistic, as opposed to sequential. I
          don't think we need to slow down the rate of progress technologically,
          especially not when other countries are moving so rapidly forward, but
          I do believe that it's incredibly important to bring in those
          marginalized voices from an early stage. Waiting too long risks
          creating systems appallingly exclusionary, and the efforts involved in
          bringing in those who were excluded afterwards are all too often so
          much greater than simply designing with them in mind to begin with.
          Inclusion shouldn't be an afterthought; it needs to be built into the
          process from the beginning, since adding justice onto systems that
          were never designed to be just isn't just inefficient—it's frequently
          counterproductive

              My user alignment I believe would be anyone in tech or gamers who
              appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai
              Namco or Kojima Productions' website is something that I find
              really interesting...<br /><a href="../blogthree/index.html"
