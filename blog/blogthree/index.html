          <p>
            My user alignment I believe would be anyone in tech or gamers who
            appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai Namco
            or Kojima Productions' website is something that I find really
            interesting. The sites use a lot of images and although text heavy
            they seem to pull the user's focus by having the text imposed on
            these images. Both websites seem to use a specific primary and
            secondary colour for everything, this seems to follow Issacharoff's
            (2021) idea that when making a design guide you should select your
            colour palette according to colour theory as well as having a main,
            secondary and tertiary colour as well neutral colours (something i
            had never considered). I'm sure there's many other colours on these
            two pages that I'm not quite noticing since they aren't as apparent
            but I believe they follow this quite well. This is a design
            principle I want to carry to my own website. A lot of the content is
            located in different pages and both sites seem to have some of this
            content located on the homepage. This is something I didn't quite
            take into account when initially planning content on my own
            homepage, I had previously planned to make the homepage include a
            simple welcome message with no additional content and a background
            image for set dressing. For user experience I don't want them to
            feel exhausted once they scroll to the bottom of my pages, I know I
            dread scrolling back up and often look for a "back-to-top" button
            which a lot of websites don't seem to have. Kojima Productions is a
            website that does have this and I think that little touch makes the
            experience of being on there quite enjoyable. The Navbar's for both
            are also equally responsive on both mobile and desktop, and have
            small opening and closing animations further enriching the
            experience, although I believe that I prefer KP's approach in that
            they have a nested menu inside of their primary one, I can see this
            working quite well for listing my blogs. Button feedback is also
            something I wish to include, I think adding a box shadow along with
            scaling up the element along with switching out the text's and bg's
            colors should work well. Although I want my website to have a soft
            feel so perhaps a slight border radius would serve me well. To tie
            this back to my own website as it currently is instead of what it
            could be, I believe the content is clearly listed in the navbar in
            alphabetical order making it less difficult to find. Each page
            seamlessly leads to the next and each blog post has its own page
            avoiding unnecessary clutter by dividing them up, lessening the risk
            of a sensory overload. This was made with the user in mind, I often
            visit websites that are too information heavy and get overwhelmed
            quite quickly, I believe keeping each page simple helps the user
            concentrate on the point being conveyed. Each blog has its own link
            located on a "blog hub" page where user's can view truncated
            versions of my main articles before deciding which to read. The
            content is kept separate on each page with the only overlap I
            predict happening being on the design page with the wireframes along
            with research of other websites. I believe having a learn more
            button could be useful, although it would have to be in a way that
            keeps the page from being bloated, perhaps grouping together similar
            ideas in batches and linking them to the relevant design. This week
            I focused mainly on ease of navigation and making sure no page was
            packed with more information than necessary. Reconciling this with
            my homepage was a bit challenging but I think I kept the information
            limited while also letting users know enough about it to decide
            whether or not they wanted to continue exploring it.

              I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the
              screen without much interference. To further this I've made use of
              space and bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide
              them to page elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to
              curate what they see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls
              down the previously displayed text...<br /><a
