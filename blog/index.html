            Reading the article “How Geography Shapes—and Is Shaped by—the
            Internet” by Greenstein, Forman, and Goldfarb (2018) through a South
            African lens reveals something important: even though the authors
            aim to show how internet infrastructure interacts with geography in
            intricate ways, they still write from a perspective where
            connectivity, infrastructure, and English are largely taken for
            granted, being an constant of day-to-day life...<br /><a

            Sheena Magenya's article on GenderIT.org in 2020 is a vision of an
            African feminist internet that subverts the reproduction of offline
            injustices online. Read from a decolonial perspective, her work is a
            challenge to digital coloniality, epistemic injustice, and colonial
            power relations embedded within technology. Magenya argues that even
            when framed as neutral, the internet reproduces the prevailing
            oppressions for African women, LGBTIQA people, and persons with
            disability. This remains the case in decolonial views of digital
            spaces as sites of struggle where coloniality of power determines
            access and visibility...<br /><a href="blogeleven/index.html"

            When thinking about how our code matters in decolonialism, I’ve
            realised in my own practice how much of coding is tied to English.
            Even though I speak English often, it’s not my first language, and
            yet, all my comments, all the syntax, and all the structure of code
            are in English. It’s not just the language itself, but the way HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and even documentation are built around a Western
            way of thinking. It makes it hard to imagine coding in a way that
            feels more personal or local...<br /><a href="blogtwelve/index.html"

            An ethical internet, to me, looks like one where every country and
            culture has a real voice and presence, not just in using the
            internet, but in shaping what it is, how it works, and what gets
            shared. As it stands right now, a lot of the internet is dominated
            by Western audiences, platforms, and priorities. This means that the
            stories told, the knowledge shared, and even the values baked into
            websites and apps often come from a narrow slice of the world. As
            Laura Stein points out in “Speech Without Rights”, most of what we
            consider the “public” internet is actually controlled by private
            entities that decide who gets to speak and what gets heard...<br /><a
