            Sheena Magenya's article on GenderIT.org in 2020 is a vision of an
            African feminist internet that subverts the reproduction of offline
            injustices online.<br />
            Read from a decolonial perspective, her work is a challenge to
            digital coloniality, epistemic injustice, and colonial power
            relations embedded within technology.<br /><br />
            Magenya argues that even when framed as neutral, the internet
            reproduces the prevailing oppressions for African women, LGBTIQA
            people, and persons with disability.<br />
            This remains the case in decolonial views of digital spaces as sites
            of struggle where coloniality of power determines access and
            visibility.<br />
            Her critique of virtual meetings replacing in-person meetings
            highlights how technological infrastructure disparities in Africa
            are not only "digital divides" but articulations of colonial
            resource extraction and unequal development.<br />
            If internet access fails to account for material barriers like cost
            and access to devices, it is yet another site of epistemic
            extractivism that redoubles colonial dependencies.<br />
            This results in a strange dynamic where African stories and
            knowledge are shared globally with minimal African input,
            potentially leading to biases or misrepresentations due to a lack of
            deep understanding of the lived experiences of local communities.<br /><br />
            The focus of the article on the "Making a Feminist Internet in
            Africa" (MFIAfrica) meeting shows collective action as epistemic
            resistance.<br />
            These African feminists, artists, and activists are the embodiment
            of what decolonial theorists call "epistemic disobedience" by
            turning dominant narratives upside down.<br />
            Their vision of a diverse internet that prioritises diversity,
            safety, and joy aligns with the decolonial concept of
            pluriversality; many worlds coexisting against Eurocentric digital
            modernity.<br /><br />
            However, social media platforms and online discussion forums where
            these conversations are likely to take place, such as Tumblr,
            Twitter, and YouTube, reveal a tension between Magenya's call for
            epistemic justice and the algorithmic coloniality of these
            platforms.<br />
            While Magenya envisions African feminists creating body-positive
            content, queer narratives, and alternative stories, the algorithmic
            prioritisation of Western-centric content often sidelines such
            nuanced contributions.<br />
            This problematic dynamic complicates the realisation of a
            decolonised internet, as even when diverse voices are present, their
            reach is curtailed by engagement-driven algorithms that favor
            perspectives aligning with colonial power structures.<br /><br />
            Furthermore, Magenya's critique of Africa's portrayal as a passive
            recipient of technology, rather than an innovator, directly
            confronts technological determinism and the coloniality of knowledge
            in digital discourse.<br />
            She challenges the "single story" narrative that frames African
            innovation as merely responsive to crises like famine or disease,
            rather than creative or playful - a narrative that perpetuates what
            decolonial scholars would identify as cognitive injustice, denying
            the legitimacy of African technological epistemologies.<br />
            This perspective deeply resonates with my framework's emphasis on
            decolonising technology, which requires recognising African
            technological sovereignty and epistemic contributions beyond Western
            frameworks of "development" or "progress."<br /><br />
            Nevertheless, platforms like YouTube and Twitter, while offering
            broad reach, often reproduce what could be termed "algorithmic
            imperialism" - encoded preferences for dominant cultural expressions
            and epistemologies.<br />
            For example, the roughly even gender split in South African social
            media users suggests potential for equitable representation, but as
            the context notes, equitable exposure is not guaranteed.<br />
            African feminist content risks being buried under algorithmically
            favored content that perpetuates colonial imaginaries, reinforcing
            the very "white tide" Magenya seeks to shift.<br /><br />
            Additionally, the article highlights the internet as a site of both
            epistemic violence and resistance.<br />
            Magenya notes the prevalence of online gender-based violence and the
            lack of legal recourse in many African countries, which aligns with
            a decolonial understanding of digital spaces as extensions of what
            Achille Mbembe terms "necropolitics" - systems that determine which
            bodies and expressions thrive online and which are rendered
            vulnerable.<br />
            Her call for African feminists to take up space, through
            storytelling, body-positive content, and cultural expression,
            positions the internet as a driving force for epistemic justice and
            digital sovereignty.<br /><br />
            Magenya's contention that Africa is portrayed as a reactive
            technology taker rather than a maker contradicts technological
            determinism and coloniality of knowledge.<br />
            She resists the "single story" discourse that positions African
            innovation as reactive and mere crisis-solving rather than being
            creative or playful, a discourse that solidifies cognitive injustice
            by dismissing African technological epistemologies as
            illegitimate.<br />
            That perspective aligns well with decolonising technology, and
            therefore, there is a requirement to recognise African technological
            sovereignty from Western logics of "development."<br /><br />
            The article highlights the internet as a site of both epistemic
            violence and counter-resistance.<br />
            Magenya addresses the endemic character of online gender violence
            and poor legal safeguards, and it aligns with seeing online sites as
            an extension of "necropolitics", systems that determine whose
            expressions make it online and whose are in jeopardy.<br />
            Her appeal to African feminists to occupy digital space through
            narrative and cultural production puts the internet at the forefront
            of epistemic justice and digital sovereignty.<br /><br />
            Nonetheless, reflecting on platform dynamics, I question how
            feasible this reclamation of digital space is when echo chambers
            like Tumblr limit exposure to diverse audiences, and broader
            platforms like Twitter amplify voices that align with colonial
            epistemologies.<br />
            The algorithmic environment can distort feminist messages, reducing
            complex decolonial narratives to clickable soundbites or sidelining
            them entirely.<br />
            This tension suggests that achieving Magenya's feminist internet
            requires not only more voices but also decolonial praxis that
            transforms platform governance and algorithmic design at fundamental
            levels.<br /><br />
            Magenya's focus on a lively internet as a place of play defies the
            utilitarian perspective of technology in Africa, a perspective based
            on colonial accounts of African technological use as necessarily
            developmental, not creative.<br />
            This is consistent with the construction of "otherwise" digital
            worlds outside colonial classifications.<br />
            However, structural expressions of digital coloniality, algorithmic
            imperialism, uneven access, and platform monopolies create major
            obstacles to making this idea a reality.<br /><br />
            In conclusion, while Magenya offers an empowering platform towards
            decolonising the internet with African feminist voices, coloniality
            embedded within digital infrastructures renders its accomplishment
            quite challenging if not implausible without centering the digital
            landscape to cater towards African audiences and a more neutral
            algorithm that caters to opposing viewpoints on social media
            platforms, within reason of course, to facilitate further
            constructive debates.<br />
