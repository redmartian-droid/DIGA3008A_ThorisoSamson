          <h2>IxD Process</h2>
          <p>
            I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the
            screen without much interference. To further this I've made use of
            space and bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide
            them to page elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to
            curate what they see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls
            down the previously displayed text will fade out to reveal the next
            sentence, I make full use of the space on screen so there's not much
            else the user sees. My website's navigation does nudge the user
            towards going to my blogs or profile first, with both of those being
            the only two to have page links outside the navbar. Small
            interactable buttons will be located on each blog card, colored the
            same as the page background to juxtapose the plain white card it's
            on (a black background was chosen as I think it adds more contrast
            to the page when it comes to this section and communicates that it
            serves a different purpose, with the buttons being the only
            components left still green I believe it communicates there's
            something further you can do with the cards). For user experience I
            plan to have each page phase in and out making it a less jarring
            transition, whether I'll be able to implement is still a wonder. My
            primary audience for this page is employees and anyone deeply
            engrossed within the tech world (video games included), this design
            approach is typical of tech companies, e.g., Clone Robotics.Links to
            an external site.<br />Websites like this tend to use maximum space,
            brief sentences and images to communicate what they do on a first
            look. I believe the most interesting content on my sight for the
            moment would be my blogs (being the only section I've worked on in
            detail aside from my home, profile and design pages), hence why I
            let it led on my homepage by being the only other page that has its
            content previewed and background changed specifically for its
            section.
          </p>
          <h2>Reflect on your work for website 1</h2>
          <p>
            Website 1 was not as much of a struggle to make as I had first
            thought, particularly with the file structure which was daunting at
            first, but I think the approach I took of having everything in its
            own folder has made navigation quite simple. I think what I did
            struggle the most was HTML placement, just deciding where goes where
            and why it should go there and whether or not that would really be
            beneficial for the user, e.g., at first my home page had nothing
            more than a greeting but I added a sub blog section that would
            redirect you to all my individual blogs. This simple navigation
            change created a shortcut which users could take to my blogs instead
            of having to use to the navbar to navigate to blog>blog # instead
            now it's an optional path in case the user wants to the greater
            compilation of my blogs. I am proud of myself for learning how to
            use all the different tags, at first, I'd use &lt;p&gt; for
            everything that was plain text including the articles, this time
            around I learned to utilise &lt;cite&gt; and &lt;article&gt;.
            Another thing is my color selection and item placement, I think I've
            structured my pages in such a way they immediately communicate what
            you're supposed to do or what you're supposed to focus on by keeping
            everything really simple. I think what I might change going forward
            is just improving my website design and observing what makes the
            tricks I'm using work on other websites and why they might not
            necessarily work on mine.

              My user alignment I believe would be anyone in tech or gamers who
              appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai
              Namco or Kojima Productions' website is something that I find
              really interesting...<br /><a href="../blogthree/index.html"
