        <div class="e-content">
          <p>
            In both my artistic and programming work, I try to approach justice
            and ethics with some kind of awareness of my own limits. I don’t
            believe in assuming what people need or want, I’d rather make sure
            the people I’m designing or building for have a voice at every stage
            of the process. That means involving them early on, listening
            carefully, and being willing to grow and change my direction based
            on their input. I think it’s unethical to tell someone else’s story
            without doing the work to understand their context, and without
            inviting them into the process directly. With that said I do
            recognise that it is not always as simple to onboard people whose
            experiences completely align with the system being built as culture,
            socio-economic factors as well as education background may effect
            the lense through which every individual approaches a problem or an
            issue however I do believe that we as developers must do our best to
            ensure that we are not excluding people from the process of building
            a system that is meant to be inclusive and accessible to all. Even
            if this does halt development cycles or delays certain features, I
            think it’s worth it to ensure that the end product is truly
            representative and useful to the people it’s meant to serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the programming side, I’m aware that I operate within systems,
            many of them Western, extractive, or profit-driven, especially in
            the US, that are hard to escape. But what I can do is be transparent
            about how and why I’m building what I’m building. I actively want to
            avoid dark patterns or manipulative design, especially when it comes
            to monetisation or engagement. I don’t think revenue should come at
            the cost of users’ well-being or agency. I look at platforms like
            tinder specifically which may be guilty of this and so much more as
            even a simple chat is monetised in such a way that most of the
            platform's features are hidden behind a paywall and if not from a
            somewhat well off bacground or are simply not willing to shell out
            money for a dating app, you are left with a very limited experience.
            I think it’s important to build systems that respect users’ time and
            attention, not just try to keep them hooked for profit, which Tinder
            is unfortunately a prime example of. I also try to avoid using data
            in ways that could harm people or communities, like selling personal
            information or using it to manipulate vulnerable groups. I think
            it’s crucial to be clear about what data is collected, how it’s
            used, and who has access to it. Tinder is in a weird midde place as
            although the data is well protected it still takes advantage of
            vulnerable groups of people who are looking for genuine
            companionship and uses that desire to exploit them for as much as
            they can.

              I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the
              screen without much interference. To further this I've made use of
              space and bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide
              them to page elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to
              curate what they see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls
              down the previously displayed text...<br /><a
