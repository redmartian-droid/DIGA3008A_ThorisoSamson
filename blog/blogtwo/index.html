            I find it interesting that Theodor Holm Nelson's concept of Xanadu
            was far removed from what we now consider the internet. The idea of
            a freely structured, decentralised internet is somewhat strange to
            think about, given that much of it today is only accessible through
            specific web browsers. For example, Google controls 78.83% of the
            global desktop search market (Bianchi, T., 2025). Hypertext, as
            Nelson envisioned, has instead reached a state of homogenisation,
            where most content in specific categories, e.g. music, is controlled
            by large corporations. Spotify possesses a hefty market share of
            31.7, more than double the market share of those subscribed to
            Tencent Music which occupies second place (Leu, P., 2024). As a
            result, users have little choice but to rely on these monopolies to
            access information, making the digital landscape highly restrictive.
            This is contrary to Nelson’s vision of a system that would set us
            free (Moulthrop, S., 2003). Update: I find the idea of Xanadu to be
            similar to blockchain, though there are key differences in how they
            function. Both store permanent records, creating new versions of
            files dynamically while preserving previous data. Additionally, both
            distribute information across a network rather than relying on a
            central server, meaning that records cannot simply be deleted—a copy
            will always exist somewhere on the network. However, one major
            difference is that blockchain requires network consensus for
            permanent changes, whereas Xanadu stores documents independently of
            each other. This approach is similar to GitHub’s version control
            system, where past versions remain accessible. From an academic
            perspective, Xanadu could have revolutionised knowledge storage and
            referencing, making citations and data permanence much more reliable
            than today's systems. Additionally, it could have prevented the
            corporate monopolisation of search engines, such as Google's
            dominance. Given Xanadu's focus on decentralising knowledge and
            promoting shared ownership, one could argue that its ideals align
            somewhat with Marxist principles. It envisioned an alternative
            digital economy, where knowledge was freely available to all, rather
            than being controlled by a few powerful entities. In that sense,
            Xanadu may have provided a more equitable model than today’s
            internet.

              thanks to some prior knowledge setting up Github was not too
              difficult. i do find publishing to pages a bit confusing...<br /><a

              appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai
              Namco or Kojima Productions' website is something that I find
              really interesting...<br /><a href="../blogthree/index.html"

              I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the
              screen without much interference. To further this I've made use of
              space and bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide
              them to page elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to
              curate what they see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls
              down the previously displayed text...<br /><a
