            Reading the article “How Geography Shapes—and Is Shaped by—the
            Internet” by Greenstein, Forman, and Goldfarb (2018) through a South
            African lens reveals something important: even though the authors
            aim to show how internet infrastructure interacts with geography in
            intricate ways, they still write from a perspective where
            connectivity, infrastructure, and English are largely taken for
            granted, being an constant of day-to-day life.<br />

            This isn’t a flaw in their article per se, their data, mostly
            U.S.-based, supports their arguments, but it does highlight just how
            invisible the Global South becomes in much of the literature on
            digital economics.<br />

            The authors use a literature review, synthesising U.S.-based
            empirical studies, theoretical models, and case studies. They cite
            firm-level adoption data, wage growth analyses across U.S. counties,
            and broadband availability studies (Greenstein et al., 2018).
            Theoretical frameworks, like models of urban agglomeration, support
            their arguments.<br />

            This approach is comprehensive but limited by its U.S. focus, which
            misses South Africa’s infrastructure and cultural complexities.
            Relying on secondary sources risks inheriting biases, and the
            qualitative discussion of globalisation lacks the rigor of other
            sections.<br />

            They aim to review literature on how the internet reshapes economic
            geography by reducing three frictions: communication costs,
            transportation costs, and search costs. It is argued that these
            reductions vary by location due to local preferences, substitutes,
            and complements, with it being stated that, “the Internet has
            different economic consequences in distinct locations because local
            factors shape the impact” (Greenstein et al., 2018).<br />

            The article challenges the “death of distance” model, analyses
            internet adoption, and explores its effects on wealth, innovation,
            consumer behavior, and globalisation. The internet’s rapid diffusion
            in the 1990s is described as transformative, reducing communication
            costs since “the cost of sending and receiving email… are the same,
            irrespective of the distance” (Greenstein et al., 2018).<br />

            Transportation costs fall for digitised goods like music, with
            “near-zero marginal cost,” and for physical goods by minimising
            travel (Greenstein et al., 2018). Search costs decrease as lower
            frictions enable easier comparisons. However, the “death of
            distance” model oversimplifies, as “some attributes may be easier to
            appreciate online than others” (Greenstein et al., 2018).<br />

            Adoption varies geographically, with urban areas benefiting from
            complements like broadband. The internet exacerbates wage
            inequality, boosts innovation but “balkanises” research, benefits
            isolated consumers, and facilitates trade, though evidence on
            globalisation is limited.<br />

            The authors conclude that the “death of distance” is too simplistic,
            calling for research into uneven outcomes. The article’s central
            argument is that the internet reduces three key types of economic
            friction, communication, transportation, and search costs, but that
            the benefit of this reduction varies based on local factors:
            preferences, access to complements (like broadband and skilled
            labour), and the availability of substitutes (Greenstein et al.,
            2018).<br />

            They push back against the idea that the internet automatically
            leads to a “death of distance,” instead showing that pre-existing
            inequalities are often amplified, not erased (Greenstein et al.,
            2018). In South Africa, this is not just true, for us it’s painfully
            familiar.<br />

            The article notes that rural and small-city areas are theoretically
            best positioned to gain from internet adoption, because they suffer
            most from communication and distribution frictions. But they also
            face the highest barriers to adoption, due to weak infrastructure
            and a lack of digital complements (Greenstein et al., 2018).<br />

            For example, 30.6% of South African households had no access to the
            internet via any device in 2021, with rural provinces like Limpopo
            and Eastern Cape recording some of the lowest connectivity levels
            (StatsSA, 2022a). These are precisely the areas where improved
            access could yield the highest returns but where access remains
            structurally limited.<br />

            The authors describe how the productivity and wage benefits of
            advanced internet services in the U.S. were concentrated in only 6%
            of counties, which were already the wealthiest (Greenstein et al.,
            2018). That statistic could almost be lifted and dropped into South
            Africa’s digital and economic landscape, Gauteng and the Western
            Cape dominate access to broadband, digital skills, and remote work
            opportunities, while the rest of the country lags behind (ICASA,
            2022).<br />

            The article sees this as a “payoff puzzle,” but in South Africa, it
            is less a puzzle than a direct result of apartheid-era spatial
            planning and ongoing inequality in infrastructure investment.<br />

            One major blind spot in the article, however, is its lack of
            engagement with language and cultural context. It makes no mention
            of how the dominance of English online might serve as a barrier in
            multilingual societies. In South Africa, only 8.4% of the population
            speaks English as a home language, while isiZulu (24.4%), isiXhosa
            (16.3%), Afrikaans (12.1%), and Setswana (8.2%) are all more widely
            spoken (StatsSA, 2022b).<br />

            Yet English continues to dominate both the official communications
            and the digital landscape, creating a disconnect between digital
            platforms and the linguistic realities of most South Africans.<br />

            When the article discusses the decline in search and communication
            costs, it does so in economic terms, how easier access to
            information improves productivity or consumer choice. But in South
            Africa, search costs are also linguistic and epistemic. Information
            may be technically available, but if it’s in English and embedded in
            culturally foreign frameworks, it is often inaccessible in
            practice.<br />

            This problem is compounded by the internet’s text-heavy,
            screen-based design, which does not reflect how knowledge has
            historically been communicated in many African contexts. Oral
            storytelling, communal memory, and face-to-face exchange remain
            central to how information is shared, especially in rural and
            traditional settings. The web simply isn’t built with that in
            mind.<br />

            Even in sections where the article discusses e-commerce and online
            consumer behaviour, arguing that the internet allows for greater
            choice, particularly in geographically isolated areas (Greenstein et
            al., 2018), it misses how South Africans in those areas often use
            the internet differently. WhatsApp and Facebook dominate usage, not
            Amazon or niche e-commerce platforms.<br />

            Data costs remain among the highest globally when adjusted for
            income, and digital literacy varies widely depending on education,
            age, and access to guidance, which are unfortunately affected by
            race and gender due to historical injustices within the country such
            as apartheid.<br />

            Due to algorithms some demographics may not receive the same
            information as another which may limit them, intentionally or not
            through omission of opportunity or knowledge.<br />

            The article closes with recommendations for future research, such as
            studying the geographic rollout of platforms like Craigslist or
            ride-sharing services like Uber (Greenstein et al., 2018). These are
            interesting proposals, but in a South African context, the questions
            need to be more foundational.<br />

            For us, the pressing issue isn’t how ride-sharing affects
            employment, it’s whether young people in rural areas even have
            access to job listings online in their language, or whether they can
            afford data to apply. I'd wager this language gap may also inhibit
            their ability to fully read through the contracts they sign with
            these ride-sharing platforms, especially if English is not the
            person's mother tongue.<br />

            The “future” of digital infrastructure in South Africa is still very
            much in the present tense, still unfinished, still deeply
            unequal.<br />

            So what does this mean for us, the people living on the ground? It
            means that while Greenstein et al.'s (2018) article offers a useful
            framework for understanding the spatial consequences of internet
            diffusion, it ultimately remains blind to the lived experience of
            marginalised, multilingual societies like South Africa.<br />

            It does not consider what it means to be digitally connected when
            your language isn’t supported, when your access is mobile-only, and
            when your digital experience is shaped by historical dispossession
            and economic exclusion.<<br />

            In this context, digital transformation is not just about cables and
            signals, it is about reclaiming space, language, and visibility
            online.<br />

            One may oppose this by saying that google translate may assist in
            bridging language barriers and they would not be entirely wrong, but
            the fact remains that the technology is not developed or curated by
            the people speaking that language in their day-to-day, or rather
            there is too little oversight from that group instead acting as a
            form of soft colonialism.<br />

            If the internet is to serve South Africans meaningfully, it must be
            decolonised. That means creating local language content, designing
            inclusive interfaces, and supporting community-owned infrastructure
            models. It means centering the oral and the relational in digital
            design.
