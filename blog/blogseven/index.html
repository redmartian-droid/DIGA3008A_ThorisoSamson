          This a UI and UX analysis of two South African brands. The purpose is
          to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the two websites. <br />1.

          external site. Pros Fast load times Significant use of pictures keeps
          the amount of text to a minimum Communicates through visual design
          Elements give feedback when hovered over or selected Cons The "2024
          AMG Notice" element leads to an error 404 and its positioning is a bit
          awkward. Usually, components like that are located on the bottom right
          of the screen and not near the center right. Some cards give double
          feedback which makes the experience of hovering over them quite
          unpleasant, the container gains a box shadow when hovered over however
          the text also gain an underline when hovered over. These two things
          seem to be independant of each other which makes it confusing on what
          I'm supposed to do next. <br />2.21 Bit Games 24 Bit GamesLinks to an

          efficiently in the site, the colors found in the logo are also used
          for the independent sections Different forms of text and image
          alignment are used to make the site appear more visually interesting
          Icons display the brands with which they've worked with in the past,
          communicating trust without needing to elaborate on each individually.
          Links are embedded in the images as well which lets you navigate to
          the site associated with said image. Cons The search Icon sends me to
          a navigated search page, something that I do not associate with the
          search icon. On other sites, search button would open up a component
          directly in the search bar where pressed.

              My user alignment I believe would be anyone in tech or gamers who
              appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai
              Namco or Kojima Productions' website is something that I find
              really interesting...<br /><a href="../blogthree/index.html"
