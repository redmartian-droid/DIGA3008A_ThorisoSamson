          thanks to some prior knowledge setting up Github was not too
          difficult. i do find publishing to pages a bit confusing but that
          comes so from my own difficulty navigating my github page. the "A
          Little History of the World Wide Web" caught me by surprise, as much
          as i know about the internet i had always just assumed, in part thanks
          to the "Transformer" film, that the US military had a hand in making
          it. instead its a lot more like a collabarative effort between all so.
          as much as they may hae helped lay the groundwork, in whatever
          capacity they may have had, it took a lot more people to really build
          on top of that to get it to resemble what we know today. i will say
          that reading up, the internet was far from being what we know today,
          especially with only recently being brough into homes through the
          "internet in a box" approach, without o'reily and co. who knows how
          using the internet would look today. around the 2000s it would seem
          that websites moved away from mostly being text based, with
          Audioscrobbler reminding me of an early Spotify in functionality and
          you can really see technologies started to move towards what we are
          most familiar with today. my goals for this course is just to
          streamline what i know on html and try to really ingrain it into my
          dna so it comes as naturally as breathing. another is to learn
          industry best practices.

          My user alignment I believe would be anyone in tech or gamers who
          appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai Namco or

          I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the screen
          without much interference. To further this I've made use of space and
          bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide them to page
          elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to curate what they
          see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls down the previously
          displayed text...<br /><a href="blogfour/index.html">read more.</a>
