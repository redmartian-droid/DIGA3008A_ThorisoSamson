            thanks to some prior knowledge setting up Github was not too
            difficult. i do find publishing to pages a bit confusing but that
            comes so from my own difficulty navigating my github page. the "A
            Little History of the World Wide Web" caught me by surprise, as much
            as i know about the internet i had always just assumed, in part
            thanks to the "Transformer" film, that the US military had a hand in
            making it. instead its a lot more like a collabarative effort
            between all so. as much as they may hae helped lay the groundwork,
            in whatever capacity they may have had, it took a lot more people to
            really build on top of that to get it to resemble what we know
            today. i will say that reading up, the internet was far from being
            what we know today, especially with only recently being brough into
            homes through the "internet in a box" approach, without O'Reily and
            co. who knows how using the internet would look today. around the
            2000s it would seem that websites moved away from mostly being text
            based, with Audioscrobbler reminding me of an early Spotify in
            functionality and you can really see technologies started to move
            towards what we are most familiar with today. my goals for this
            course is just to streamline what i know on html and try to really
            ingrain it into my dna so it comes as naturally as breathing.
            another is to learn industry best practices.

              I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the
              screen without much interference. To further this I've made use of
              space and bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide
              them to page elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to
              curate what they see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls
              down the previously displayed text...<br /><a
